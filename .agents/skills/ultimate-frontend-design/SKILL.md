# Ultimate Frontend Design

> **Agent Instruction:** This is a consolidated expert skill. Read the catalog below and apply the specific rules that match the user's request. Do not mix conflicting styles or rules.

## Skill Catalog

### design-taste-frontend
**Description:** Anti-slop frontend skill for landing pages, portfolios, and redesigns. The agent reads the brief, infers the right design direction, and ships interfaces that do not look templated. Real design systems when applicable, audit-first on redesigns, strict pre-flight check.


#### tasteskill: Anti-Slop Frontend Skill

> Landing pages, portfolios, and redesigns. Not dashboards, not data tables, not multi-step product UI.
> Every rule below is **contextual**. None of it fires automatically. First read the brief, then pull only what fits.

---

##### 0. BRIEF INFERENCE (Read the Room Before Anything Else)

Before touching code or tweaking dials, **infer what the user actually wants**. Most LLM design output is bad because the model jumps to a default aesthetic instead of reading the room.

###### 0.A Read these signals first
1. **Page kind** - landing (SaaS / consumer / agency / event), portfolio (dev / designer / creative studio), redesign (preserve vs overhaul), editorial / blog.
2. **Vibe words** the user used - "minimalist", "calm", "Linear-style", "Awwwards", "brutalist", "premium consumer", "Apple-y", "playful", "serious B2B", "editorial", "agency-y", "glassy", "dark tech".
3. **Reference signals** - URLs they linked, screenshots they pasted, products they named, brands they're competing with.
4. **Audience** - B2B procurement panel vs. design-conscious consumer vs. recruiter scanning a portfolio. The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste.
5. **Brand assets that already exist** - logo, color, type, photography. For redesigns, these are starting material, not optional input (see Section 11).
6. **Quiet constraints** - accessibility-first audiences, public-sector, regulated industries, trust-first commerce, kids' products. These constraints OVERRIDE aesthetic preference.

###### 0.B Output a one-line "Design Read" before generating
Before any code, state in one line: **"Reading this as: \<page kind> for \<audience>, with a \<vibe> language, leaning toward \<design system or aesthetic family>."**

Example reads:
- *"Reading this as: B2B SaaS landing for technical buyers, with a Linear-style minimalist language, leaning toward Tailwind utilities + Geist + restrained motion."*
- *"Reading this as: solo designer portfolio for hiring managers, with an editorial / kinetic-type language, leaning toward native CSS + scroll-driven animation + custom typography."*
- *"Reading this as: redesign of a public-sector service site, with a trust-first language, leaning toward GOV.UK Frontend or USWDS."*

###### 0.C If the brief is ambiguous, ask one question, do not guess
Ask exactly **one** clarifying question - never a multi-question dump - and only when the design read genuinely diverges. Example: *"Should this feel closer to Linear-clean or Awwwards-experimental?"*

If you can confidently infer from context, **do not ask**. Just declare the design read and proceed.

###### 0.D Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: AI-purple gradients, centered hero over dark mesh, three equal feature cards, generic glassmorphism on everything, infinite-loop micro-animations everywhere, Inter + slate-900. These are the LLM defaults. Reach past them deliberately based on the design read.

---

##### 1. THE THREE DIALS (Core Configuration)

After the design read, set three dials. Every layout, motion, and density decision below is gated by these.

* **`DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`** - 1 = Perfect Symmetry, 10 = Artsy Chaos
* **`MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`** - 1 = Static, 10 = Cinematic / Physics
* **`VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`** - 1 = Art Gallery / Airy, 10 = Cockpit / Packed Data

**Baseline:** `8 / 6 / 4`. Use these unless the design read overrides them. Do not ask the user to edit this file - overrides happen conversationally.

###### 1.A Dial Inference (design read → dial values)
| Signal | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| "minimalist / clean / calm / editorial / Linear-style" | 5-6 | 3-4 | 2-3 |
| "premium consumer / Apple-y / luxury / brand" | 7-8 | 5-7 | 3-4 |
| "playful / wild / Dribbble / Awwwards / experimental / agency" | 9-10 | 8-10 | 3-4 |
| "landing page / portfolio / marketing site (default)" | 7-9 | 6-8 | 3-5 |
| "trust-first / public-sector / regulated / accessibility-critical" | 3-4 | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| "redesign - preserve" | match existing | +1 | match existing |
| "redesign - overhaul" | +2 | +2 | match existing |

###### 1.B Use-Case Presets
| Use case | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing (SaaS, mainstream) | 7 | 6 | 4 |
| Landing (Agency / creative) | 9 | 8 | 3 |
| Landing (Premium consumer) | 7 | 6 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Designer / studio) | 8 | 7 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Developer) | 6 | 5 | 4 |
| Editorial / Blog | 6 | 4 | 3 |
| Public-sector service | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| Redesign - preserve | match | match+1 | match |
| Redesign - overhaul | +2 | +2 | match |

###### 1.C How the Dials Drive Output
Use these (or user-overridden values) as global variables. Cross-references throughout this document refer to these exact variable names - never invent aliases like `LAYOUT_VARIANCE` or `ANIM_LEVEL`.

---

##### 2. BRIEF → DESIGN SYSTEM MAP

Once you have the design read (Section 0) and dials (Section 1), pick the right foundation. Do not invent CSS for things that have an official package. Do not pretend an aesthetic trend is an official system.

###### 2.A When to reach for a real design system (use official packages)
| Brief reads as… | Reach for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft / enterprise SaaS / dashboards | `@fluentui/react-components` or `@fluentui/web-components` | Official Fluent UI, Microsoft tokens, accessibility done |
| Google-ish UI, Material-flavored product | `@material/web` + Material 3 tokens | Official, theme-able via Material Theming |
| IBM-style B2B / enterprise analytics | `@carbon/react` + `@carbon/styles` | Official Carbon, mature data-density patterns |
| Shopify app surfaces | `polaris.js` web components / Polaris React | Required for Shopify admin UI |
| Atlassian / Jira-style product | `@atlaskit/*` + `@atlaskit/tokens` | Official Atlassian DS |
| GitHub-style devtool / community page | `@primer/css` or `@primer/react-brand` | Official Primer; Brand variant for marketing |
| Public-sector UK service | `govuk-frontend` | Legally / regulatorily expected |
| US public-sector / trust-first | `uswds` | Same |
| Fast local-business / agency MVP | Bootstrap 5.3 | Boring, fast, works |
| Modern accessible React foundation | `@radix-ui/themes` | Primitives + polished theme |
| Modern SaaS where you own the components | shadcn/ui (`npx shadcn@latest add ...`) | You own the code, easy to customise; never ship default state |
| Tailwind-based modern SaaS / AI marketing | Tailwind v4 utilities + `dark:` variant | Default for indie + small team builds |

**Honesty rule:** if the brief reads as one of the systems above, install and use the **official** package. Do not recreate its CSS by hand. Do not import a system's tokens but then override 90% of them.

**One system per project.** Do not mix Fluent React with Carbon in the same tree. Do not import shadcn/ui components into a Material 3 app.

###### 2.B When the brief is an aesthetic, not a system
For these directions, there is **no single official package**. Build with native CSS + Tailwind + a maintained component library. Be honest in code comments about what is borrowed inspiration vs. official material.

| Aesthetic | Honest implementation |
|---|---|
| Glassmorphism / "frosted glass" | `backdrop-filter`, layered borders, highlight overlays. Provide solid-fill fallback for `prefers-reduced-transparency`. |
| Bento (Apple-style tile grids) | CSS Grid with mixed cell sizes. No single library owns this. |
| Brutalism | Native CSS, monospace, raw borders. No library. |
| Editorial / magazine | Serif type, asymmetric grid, generous whitespace. No library. |
| Dark tech / hacker | Mono + accent neon, terminal motifs. No library. |
| Aurora / mesh gradients | SVG or layered radial gradients. No library. |
| Kinetic typography | Native CSS animations, scroll-driven animations, GSAP for hijacks. No library. |
| **Apple Liquid Glass** | Apple documents this for Apple platforms only. **There is no official `liquid-glass.css`.** Web implementations are approximations using `backdrop-filter` + layered borders + highlights. Label clearly as approximation. |

---

##### 3. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS

Unless the design read picks a real design system (Section 2.A), these are the defaults:

###### 3.A Stack
* **Framework:** React or Next.js. Default to Server Components (RSC).
  * **RSC SAFETY:** Global state works ONLY in Client Components. In Next.js, wrap providers in a `"use client"` component.
  * **INTERACTIVITY ISOLATION:** Any component using Motion, scroll listeners, or pointer physics MUST be an isolated leaf with `'use client'` at the top. Server Components render static layouts only.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind v4** (default). Tailwind v3 only if the existing project demands it.
  * For v4: do NOT use `tailwindcss` plugin in `postcss.config.js`. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` or the Vite plugin.
* **Animation:** **Motion** (the library formerly known as Framer Motion). Import from `motion/react` (`import { motion } from "motion/react"`). The `framer-motion` package still works as a legacy alias - prefer `motion/react` in new code.
* **Fonts:** Always use `next/font` (Next.js) or self-host with `@font-face` + `font-display: swap`. Never link Google Fonts via `<link>` in production.

###### 3.B State
* Local `useState` / `useReducer` for isolated UI.
* Global state ONLY for deep prop-drilling avoidance - Zustand, Jotai, or React context.
* **NEVER** use `useState` to track continuous values driven by user input (mouse position, scroll progress, pointer physics, magnetic hover). Use Motion's `useMotionValue` / `useTransform` / `useScroll`. `useState` re-renders the React tree on every change and collapses on mobile.

###### 3.C Icons
* **Allowed libraries (priority order):** `@phosphor-icons/react`, `hugeicons-react`, `@radix-ui/react-icons`, `@tabler/icons-react`.
* **Discouraged:** `lucide-react`. Acceptable only when the user explicitly asks for it or the project already depends on it.
* **NEVER hand-roll SVG icons.** If a glyph is missing, install a second library or compose from primitives - do not draw icon paths from scratch.
* **One family per project.** Do not mix Phosphor with Lucide in the same component tree.
* **Standardize `strokeWidth` globally** (e.g. `1.5` or `2.0`).

###### 3.D Emoji Policy
Discouraged by default in code, markup, and visible text. Replace symbols with icon-library glyphs. **Override:** allow emojis only when the user explicitly asks for a playful / chat-style / social-native vibe - and even then use them sparingly with intent.

###### 3.E Responsiveness & Layout Mechanics
* Standardize breakpoints (`sm 640`, `md 768`, `lg 1024`, `xl 1280`, `2xl 1536`).
* Contain page layouts using `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or `max-w-7xl`.
* **Viewport Stability:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent layout jumping on mobile (iOS Safari address bar).
* **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`).

###### 3.F Dependency Verification (mandatory)
Before importing ANY 3rd-party library, check `package.json`. If the package is missing, output the install command first. **Never** assume a library exists.

---

##### 4. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)

LLMs default to clichés. Override these defaults proactively. Each rule has a context-aware override path.

###### 4.1 Typography
* **Display / Headlines:** Default `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.
* **Body / Paragraphs:** Default `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.
* **Sans font choice:**
  * **Discouraged as default:** `Inter`. Pick `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, `Satoshi`, or a brand-appropriate serif first.
  * **Override:** Inter is acceptable when the user explicitly asks for a neutral / standard / Linear-style feel, or when the brief is a public-sector / accessibility-first site.
* **Pairings to know:** `Geist` + `Geist Mono`, `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`, `Cabinet Grotesk` + `Inter Tight`, `GT America` + `IBM Plex Mono`.

* **SERIF DISCIPLINE (VERY DISCOURAGED AS DEFAULT):**
  * Serif is **very discouraged as the default font for any project.** "It feels creative / premium / editorial" is NOT a reason to reach for serif. The agent's default mental model that "creative brief = serif" is the single most-tested AI tell in production rounds.
  * **Serif is only acceptable when ONE of these is explicitly true:**
    - The brand brief literally names a serif font, OR
    - The aesthetic family is genuinely editorial / luxury / publication / manuscript / heritage / vintage AND you can articulate why this specific serif fits this specific brand
  * For everything else (creative agency, design studio, modern brand, premium consumer, portfolio, lifestyle), **default sans-serif display** (Geist Display, ABC Diatype, Söhne Breit, Cabinet Grotesk Display, Migra Sans, GT Walsheim, Inter Display, PP Neue Montreal). Sans display fonts are not "boring" — they are the default for the same reason black is the default in fashion.
  * **EMPHASIS RULE (related):** When you want to emphasize a word within a headline (the kinetic "and `spatial` design" type move), use **italic or bold of the SAME font**. Do NOT inject a random serif word into a sans headline (or vice versa) just to add visual interest. Mixed-family emphasis is amateur. Italic/bold emphasis in the same family is the right move.
  * **Specifically BANNED as defaults:** `Fraunces` and `Instrument_Serif` (the two LLM-favorite display serifs).
  * **If a serif is justified** (rare, per the above), rotate from this pool, do NOT reuse the same serif across consecutive projects: PP Editorial New, GT Sectra Display, Cardinal Grotesque, Reckless Neue, Tiempos Headline, Recoleta, Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, EB Garamond, IvyPresto, Migra, Editorial Old, Saol Display, Söhne Breit Kursiv, Domaine Display, Canela, Schnyder, Tobias, NB Architekt, ITC Galliard.

* **ITALIC DESCENDER CLEARANCE (mandatory):** When italic is used in display type and the word contains a descender letter (`y g j p q`), `leading-[1]` or `leading-none` will clip the descender. Use `leading-[1.1]` minimum and add `pb-1` or `mb-1` reserve on the wrapping element. Audit every italic word in display headlines before shipping.

###### 4.2 Color Calibration
* Max 1 accent color. Saturation < 80% by default.
* **THE LILA RULE:** The "AI Purple / Blue glow" aesthetic is discouraged as a default. No automatic purple button glows, no random neon gradients. Use neutral bases (Zinc / Slate / Stone) with high-contrast singular accents (Emerald, Electric Blue, Deep Rose, Burnt Orange, etc.).
* **Override:** if the brand or brief explicitly asks for purple / violet / lila, embrace it. But execute with intent: consistent palette, harmonised neutrals, restrained gradients. Not generic AI gradient slop.
* **One palette per project.** Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.
* **COLOR CONSISTENCY LOCK (mandatory):** Once an accent color is chosen for a page, it is used on the WHOLE page. A warm-grey site does not suddenly get a blue CTA in section 7. A rose-accented site does not get a teal status badge in the footer. Pick one accent, lock it, audit every component before shipping.

* **PREMIUM-CONSUMER PALETTE BAN (mandatory, second-most-recurring AI-tell):**
  * For premium-consumer briefs (cookware, wellness, artisan, luxury, heritage craft, DTC home goods, etc.) the LLM default is **warm beige/cream + brass/clay/oxblood/ochre + espresso/ink dark text**. Concretely banned hex families as default backgrounds and accents:
    - Backgrounds: `#f5f1ea`, `#f7f5f1`, `#fbf8f1`, `#efeae0`, `#ece6db`, `#faf7f1`, `#e8dfcb` (all "warm paper / cream / chalk / bone")
    - Accents: `#b08947`, `#b6553a`, `#9a2436`, `#9c6e2a`, `#bc7c3a`, `#7d5621` (all "brass / clay / oxblood / ochre")
    - Text: `#1a1714`, `#1a1814`, `#1b1814` (all "espresso / warm near-black")
  * This palette is BANNED as the default reach for premium-consumer briefs. Every premium-consumer site you have ever shipped uses this exact palette. The brand becomes invisible.
  * **Default alternatives (rotate, do not reuse):**
    - **Cold Luxury:** silver-grey + chrome + smoke (think Tesla, Apple Watch Hermes-without-the-leather)
    - **Forest:** deep green + bone + amber accent (think Filson, Patagonia premium)
    - **Black and Tan:** true off-black + warm tan, sharp contrast, no beige
    - **Cobalt + Cream:** saturated blue against a single neutral, no brass
    - **Terracotta + Slate:** warm rust against cool grey, no brass
    - **Olive + Brick + Paper:** muted olive plus brick-red accent
    - **Pure monochrome + single saturated pop:** off-white + off-black + one bright accent (electric blue, emerald, hot pink, etc.)
  * **Palette-rotation rule:** if the previous premium-consumer project you generated used the beige+brass family, this one MUST use a different family. Do not ship the same warm-craft palette twice in a row.
  * **Override:** the beige+brass+espresso palette is acceptable ONLY when the brand brief explicitly names those colors, or when the brand identity is genuinely vintage / artisan / warm-craft AND you can articulate why this specific palette fits this specific brand. Default-reaching for it because "this is a cookware brief" is banned.

###### 4.3 Layout Diversification
* **ANTI-CENTER BIAS:** Centered Hero / H1 sections are avoided when `DESIGN_VARIANCE > 4`. Force "Split Screen" (50/50), "Left-aligned content / right-aligned asset", "Asymmetric white-space", or scroll-pinned structures.
* **Override:** centered hero is OK for editorial / manifesto / launch-announcement briefs where the message itself is the design.

###### 4.4 Materiality, Shadows, Cards
* Use cards ONLY when elevation communicates real hierarchy. Otherwise group with `border-t`, `divide-y`, or negative space.
* When a shadow is used, tint it to the background hue. No pure-black drop shadows on light backgrounds.
* For `VISUAL_DENSITY > 7`: generic card containers are banned. Data metrics breathe in plain layout.
* **SHAPE CONSISTENCY LOCK (mandatory):** Pick ONE corner-radius scale for the page and stick to it. Options: all-sharp (radius 0), all-soft (radius 12-16px), all-pill (full radius for interactive). Mixed systems are allowed only when there is a documented rule (e.g. "buttons are full-pill, cards are 16px, inputs are 8px") and that rule is followed everywhere. Round buttons in a square layout, or square cards on a pill-button page, is broken design.

###### 4.5 Interactive UI States
LLMs default to "static successful state only." Always implement full cycles:
* **Loading:** Skeletal loaders matching the final layout's shape. Avoid generic circular spinners.
* **Empty States:** Beautifully composed; indicate how to populate.
* **Error States:** Clear, inline (forms), or contextual (toasts only for transient).
* **Tactile Feedback:** On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push.
* **BUTTON CONTRAST CHECK (mandatory, a11y):** Before shipping any button, verify the button text is readable against the button background. White button + white text, `bg-white` CTA with `text-white` label, transparent button against the page background with no border → all banned. Audit every CTA: contrast ratio WCAG AA min (4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text 18px+). Same rule applies to ghost buttons over photographic backgrounds (use a backdrop, scrim, or stroke).
* **CTA BUTTON WRAP BAN (mandatory):** Button text MUST fit on one line at desktop. If a label like "VIEW SELECTED WORK" wraps to 2 or 3 lines, the button is broken. Fix by EITHER shortening the label (3 words max for primary CTAs, ideally 1-2) OR widening the button (do not artificially constrain `max-width` on CTAs). Wrapped CTAs at desktop are a Pre-Flight Fail.
* **NO DUPLICATE CTA INTENT (mandatory):** Two CTAs with the same intent on one page is a Pre-Flight Fail. Examples of same intent: "Get in touch" + "Contact us" + "Let's talk" + "Start a project" + "Start something" + "Reach out" = all "contact" intent → pick ONE label and use it everywhere on the page (nav, hero, footer). Same for "Try free" + "Get started" + "Sign up free" (all "signup" intent) and "View work" + "See selected work" + "Browse projects" (all "portfolio" intent). One label per intent.
* **FORM CONTRAST CHECK (mandatory, a11y):** Form inputs, placeholder text, focus rings, helper text, and error text all pass WCAG AA contrast against the section background. Light placeholders on a near-white form, white form on white page section, form labels grayer than 4.5:1 contrast → all banned. Audit every form before shipping.

###### 4.6 Data & Form Patterns
* Label ABOVE input. Helper text optional but present in markup. Error text BELOW input. Standard `gap-2` for input blocks.
* No placeholder-as-label. Ever.

###### 4.7 Layout Discipline (Hard Rules. Failing any of these is shipping broken work)

* **Hero MUST fit in the initial viewport.** Headline max 2 lines on desktop, subtext max **20 words** AND max 3-4 lines, CTAs visible without scroll. If the copy is too long: reduce font scale OR cut copy. If you cannot describe the value-prop in 20 words of subtext, the value-prop is unclear, not the rule too tight. Never let the hero overflow and force scroll to find the CTA.
* **Hero font-scale discipline.** Plan font size and image size *together*. If the hero asset is large and the headline is more than 6 words, do not start at `text-7xl/text-8xl`. Default sensible range: `text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl` for most heroes; `text-6xl md:text-7xl` only when the headline is 3-5 words. A 4-line hero headline is always a font-size error, never a copy-length error.
* **HERO TOP PADDING CAP (mandatory):** Hero top padding max `pt-24` (≈6rem) at desktop. More than that means the hero content floats halfway down the viewport and reads as a layout bug, not as intentional space. If your hero needs more breathing room, increase font scale or asset size, not top padding.
* **HERO STACK DISCIPLINE (max 4 text elements).** The hero is a single moment, not a feature list. Allowed text elements, max 4 in total:
  1. Eyebrow (small uppercase label) OR brand strip OR neither - pick zero or one
  2. Headline (max 2 lines, see above)
  3. Subtext (max 20 words, max 4 lines)
  4. CTAs (1 primary + max 1 secondary)
  - **BANNED in the hero:** tiny tagline below CTAs ("Works with GitHub, GitLab, and self-hosted Git"), trust micro-strip ("Used by engineering teams at..."), pricing teaser ("Free for solo, $10/user for teams"), feature bullet list, social-proof avatar row. All of those move to dedicated sections directly below the hero.
  - If you have an eyebrow AND a tagline below CTAs in the same hero, drop the tagline. If you have a brand strip AND a tagline, drop the tagline. One small text element per hero, max.
* **"Used by" / "Trusted by" logo wall belongs UNDER the hero, never inside it.** The hero is for the value prop and primary CTA. The logo wall is a separate section directly below. Do not stuff trust logos into the same flex row as the hero copy.
* **Navigation MUST render on a single line on desktop.** If items don't fit at `lg` (1024px), condense labels, drop secondary items, or move to a hamburger. A two-line nav at desktop is broken design.
* **Navigation height cap: 80px max desktop, default 64-72px.** No huge "agency" nav bars that eat 15% of the viewport.
* **Bento grids MUST have rhythm, not one-sided repetition.** Do not stack 6 left-image / right-text rows. Vary the composition: alternate full-width feature rows, asymmetric tile sizes, vertical breaks.
* **BENTO CELL COUNT RULE (mandatory):** A bento grid has EXACTLY as many cells as you have content for. 3 items → 3 cells (1+2 split, or 2+1, or asymmetric trio). 5 items → 5 cells (2+3, 3+2, hero+4, etc.). If your grid has an empty cell in the middle or at the end, you planned wrong. Re-shape the grid; do not paste a blank tile.
* **Section-Layout-Repetition Ban.** Once you use a layout family for a section (e.g., 3-column-image-cards, full-width-quote, split-text-image), that family can appear at most ONCE on the page. "Selected commissions" must not look like "What we do." A landing page with 8 sections must use at least 4 different layout families.
* **ZIGZAG ALTERNATION CAP (mandatory).** Alternating "left-image + right-text" then "left-text + right-image" zigzag layout = banal. Max 2 sections in a row with this image+text-split pattern. The 3rd consecutive image+text split is a Pre-Flight Fail. Break the pattern with a full-width section, a vertical-stack section, a bento grid, a marquee, or a different layout family.
* **EYEBROW RESTRAINT (mandatory, the #1 violated rule in production tests).** An "eyebrow" is the small uppercase wide-tracking label sitting above a section headline (e.g. `FOUR COLORWAYS`, `SELECTED WORK`, `THE HARDWARE`, `Git-native task management`). Typical CSS signature: `text-[11px] uppercase tracking-[0.18em]`, `font-mono text-[10.5px] uppercase tracking-[0.22em]`. Every AI-built site puts an eyebrow above EVERY section header, producing the same templated rhythm. Hard rule:
  - **Maximum 1 eyebrow per 3 sections.** Hero counts as 1. So a page with 9 sections may use at most 3 eyebrows total.
  - If section A has an eyebrow, the next 2 sections cannot have one.
  - **Pre-Flight Check is mechanical:** count instances of `uppercase tracking` (or similar small-caps mono labels above headlines) across all section components. If count > ceil(sectionCount / 3), the output fails.
  - **What to do instead of an eyebrow:** drop it entirely. The headline alone is enough. If you need to categorize a section, the section's location on the page already categorizes it; no label needed.
* **SPLIT-HEADER BAN (mandatory).** The pattern "left big headline + right small explainer paragraph" as a section header (left col-span-7/8, right col-span-4/5 with a small body paragraph floating in the right column) is **banned as default**. Sections should have ONE focused message. If you genuinely need both a headline and an explainer paragraph, stack them vertically (headline on top, body below, max-width 65ch). Reach for the split-header pattern only when there is a real compositional reason (e.g., the right column carries a visual or interactive element, not just filler text).
* **Bento Background Diversity (mandatory).** Bento and feature-grid sections cannot be 6 white-on-white cards with text inside. At least 2-3 cells in any multi-cell grid need real visual variation: a real image, a brand-appropriate gradient (not AI-purple), a pattern, a tinted background. A cream-on-cream bento with only typography inside reads as boring AI default, even when the rest of the page is good.
* **Mobile collapse must be explicit per section.** For every multi-column layout, declare the `< 768px` fallback in the same component. No "it'll work, Tailwind handles it" assumptions.

###### 4.8 Image & Visual Asset Strategy

Landing pages and portfolios are **visual products**. Text-only pages with fake-screenshot divs are slop.

**Priority order for visual assets:**
1. **Image-generation tool first.** If ANY image-gen tool is available in the environment (`generate_image`, MCP image tool, IDE-integrated gen, OpenAI image tools, etc.) you MUST use it to create section-specific assets: hero photography, product shots, texture backgrounds, mood images. Generate at the right aspect ratio for the section. Do not skip this step because hand-rolled CSS feels faster.
2. **Real web images second.** When no gen tool is available, use real photography sources. Acceptable defaults:
   * `https://picsum.photos/seed/{descriptive-seed}/{w}/{h}` for placeholder photography (seed should describe the section, e.g. `marrow-cookware-kitchen`)
   * Actual stock or brand URLs when the brief provides them
   * Open-license sources (Unsplash via direct URL, Pexels) if explicitly allowed
3. **Last resort: tell the user.** If neither is possible, do NOT fill the page with hand-rolled SVG illustrations or div-based "fake screenshots." Instead, leave clearly-labeled placeholder slots (`<!-- TODO: hero product photo, 1600x1200 -->`) and at the end of the response say: *"This page needs real images at: \[list of placements\]. Please generate or provide them."*

**Even minimalist sites need real images.** A pure-text page is not minimalism. It is incomplete work. Even an editorial Linear-style site needs at least 2-3 real images (hero, one product/lifestyle shot, one supporting image). Generate B&W minimalist photography if the brief is restrained; do not skip images entirely because the dial is low.

**Real company logos for social proof.** When the brief calls for a "Trusted by / Used by / Customers" logo wall, do NOT default to plain text wordmarks (`<span>Acme Co</span>` styled in a row). Use real SVG logos:
* **Source: Simple Icons** (`https://cdn.simpleicons.org/{slug}/ffffff` for any color, or `simple-icons` npm package). Covers most known brands.
* **Alternative: devicon** for tech-stack logos (`@svgr/cli` or CDN).
* **Make-up the brand name? Then make-up an SVG mark too.** Generate a simple monogram (one letter in a circle, two-letter ligature, abstract glyph) rendered as an inline `<svg>` matching the page style. Plain text wordmarks for invented brand names look generic.
* **Always** ensure logos render in both light and dark mode (white-on-dark, black-on-light, or single-color theme variable).
* **LOGO-ONLY rule (mandatory):** logo wall = logos and nothing else. Do NOT print industry / category labels below each logo (no `Vercel` + `hosting` underneath, no `Stripe` + `payments`, no `Cloudflare` + `infra`). The logo is the credibility, the label adds nothing the user does not already know. Optional: brand name as alt-text for screen readers, optional link to the brand's site. That is it.

**Hand-rolled illustrations:**
* SVG icons from libraries: fine (see Section 3.C).
* Hand-rolled decorative SVGs (custom illustrations, logos, marks): **strongly discouraged**, never as default. Acceptable only when:
  - The brief explicitly calls for it ("draw me an SVG logo")
  - It's a single, simple geometric mark (a square, a circle, a wordmark in display type)
  - You're confident in the output quality

**Div-based fake screenshots are banned.** A "hand-built product preview" rendered with `<div>` rectangles, fake task lists, fake dashboards, fake terminal windows is a Tell. If you need to show a product:
* Use a real screenshot URL if one exists
* Generate one via image tool
* Use a real component preview (an actual mini-version of the UI inside the page)
* Or skip the preview entirely and use editorial photography

**Hero needs a real visual.** Text + gradient blob is not a hero - it's a placeholder.

###### 4.9 Content Density

Landing pages live on the **first impression**, not the full read. Cut ruthlessly.

* **Default content shape per section:** short headline (≤ 8 words) + short sub-paragraph (≤ 25 words) + one visual asset OR one CTA. Anything more must be justified by the section's job.
* **No data-dump sections.** A 20-row publication table, a 30-row award list, a giant pricing matrix on a marketing page = wrong layout. Use:
  - Top 3-5 highlights + "View full list" link
  - Marquee / carousel for breadth
  - Different page entirely if the data is the product
* **Long lists need a different UI component, not a longer list.** Default `<ul>` with bullets / `divide-y` rows is the lazy choice. If you have > 5 items, reach for one of these instead:
  - 2-column split with grouped items
  - Card grid with image + label per item
  - Tabs / accordion if items are categorisable
  - Horizontal scroll-snap pills
  - Carousel for breadth-heavy lists (testimonials, logos, capabilities)
  - Marquee for "lots-of-things-that-don't-need-individual-attention"
  A spec sheet with 10 rows + a hairline under every row is the WORST default. Either group rows into 2-3 chunks with sparse dividers, or move to a card-per-spec layout.
* **Spec sheets specifically (the Marrow-cookware pattern).** A long product specification table with `border-b` on every row is the AI default for cookware / hardware / apparel / artisan-goods briefs. Banned. Concrete alternatives:
  - **2-col card grid:** each spec gets its own card with the spec name, the value (large display number), and a one-line "why it matters" body. Cards arranged 2-col on desktop, 1-col mobile.
  - **Scroll-snap horizontal pills:** each spec is a pill, user can flick through.
  - **Grouped chunks:** group 10 specs into 3 logical clusters (e.g. "Materials", "Cooking", "Warranty"), each cluster gets ONE soft divider and a cluster heading.
  - **Featured-vs-rest:** 3-4 hero specs visualised as large display tiles, the rest collapsed under a "View full specifications" disclosure.

* **COPY SELF-AUDIT (mandatory before ship):** Before declaring any task done, re-read every visible string on the page (headlines, subheads, eyebrows, button labels, body copy, captions, alt text, footer text, error messages). Flag any string that is:
  - **Grammatically broken** ("free on its past", "two plans but one is honest", "to put it on the table" out of context)
  - **Has unclear referents** ("we plan to stay that way" without prior context)
  - **Sounds like AI hallucination** (cute-but-wrong wordplay, forced metaphors that don't track, "elegant nothing" phrases)
  - **Reads like an LLM trying to sound thoughtful** (passive-aggressive humility, fake-craftsman labels, mock-poetic micro-meta)
  Rewrite every flagged string. If unsure whether a string makes sense, replace it with a plain functional sentence. AI-generated cute copy is worse than boring copy.
* **Fake-precise numbers are flagged.** Numbers like `92%`, `4.1×`, `48k`, `5.8 mm`, `13.4 lb` either:
  - Come from real data (brief, brand guidelines, public metrics) - fine
  - Are explicitly labeled as mock (`<!-- mock -->`, "example", "sample data") - fine
  - Are AI-invented spec aesthetics - banned. Don't fake engineering precision the brand doesn't claim.
* **One copy register per page.** Don't mix technical mono ("47 tasks · 0.6 ctx-switches/day"), editorial prose, and marketing punch in the same composition unless the brand voice explicitly calls for it.

###### 4.10 Quotes & Testimonials

* **Max 3 lines** of quote body. Never 6. If the original quote is longer → cut it. A landing-page quote is a snippet, not the full review.
* For very small font sizes (e.g. footer-style testimonials), the line cap can stretch slightly. Spirit: "fits in a glance."
* **No em-dashes inside the quote text** as design flourish (long pauses, kinetic em-dashes, em-dash-bullets). See Section 9.G - em-dash is completely banned.
* Attribution: name + role + (optionally) company. Never name only ("- Sarah").
* Quote marks: use real typographic quotes ( " " ) or none at all. Not straight ASCII ( " ).

###### 4.11 Page Theme Lock (Light / Dark Mode Consistency)

The page has ONE theme. Sections do not invert.

* If the page is dark mode, ALL sections are dark mode. No light-mode-warm-paper section sandwiched between dark sections (or vice versa). The user must not feel they walked into a different website mid-scroll.
* The exception: if the brief explicitly calls for a "Color Block Story" or "Theme Switch on Scroll" device AND that is a deliberate composition (one full theme switch with a strong transition, not random alternation), it is allowed once per page.
* Default behaviour: pick light, dark, or auto (`prefers-color-scheme`) at the page level and lock it. Section-level background tints within the same theme family are fine (`bg-zinc-950` next to `bg-zinc-900`); flipping to `bg-amber-50` in the middle of a `bg-zinc-950` page is broken.
* When using a design system with built-in theming (Radix Themes, shadcn/ui with `<Theme>`), set the theme ONCE in `layout.tsx` or the page root. Do not let individual sections override.

---

##### 5. CONTEXT-AWARE PROACTIVITY

These are tools, not defaults. Use them when the design read calls for them. **None of these fire automatically.**

* **Liquid Glass / Glassmorphism:** Appropriate for premium consumer, Apple-adjacent, luxury brand, or media-overlay vibes. Inappropriate for dashboards, public-sector, or "boring B2B." When used, go beyond `backdrop-blur`: add a 1px inner border (`border-white/10`) and a subtle inner shadow (`shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1)]`) for physical edge refraction. Provide a solid-fill fallback under `prefers-reduced-transparency`.
* **Magnetic Micro-physics:** Use when `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5` AND the brief reads premium / playful / agency. Implement EXCLUSIVELY with Motion's `useMotionValue` / `useTransform` outside the React render cycle. Never `useState`. See Section 3.B.
* **Perpetual Micro-Interactions** (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer, Carousel): Use when `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5` AND the section actively benefits from motion (status indicators, live feeds, AI-feel). **Not every card needs an infinite loop.** If a section is informational, leave it still. Apply Spring Physics (`type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`) - no linear easing.
* **"Motion claimed, motion shown."** If `MOTION_INTENSITY > 4`, the page must actually move: entry transitions on hero, scroll-reveal on key sections, hover physics on CTAs, at minimum. A static page that claims `MOTION_INTENSITY: 7` is broken. Conversely, if you cannot ship working motion in the available scope, drop the dial to 3 and ship a clean static page. Never half-build motion that breaks (cut-off ScrollTriggers, jumpy enters, missing cleanups).
* **MOTION MUST BE MOTIVATED (mandatory).** Before adding any animation, ask: "what does this animation communicate?" Valid answers: hierarchy (drawing attention to the right thing), storytelling (revealing content in sequence that matches a narrative), feedback (acknowledging a user action), state transition (showing something changed). Invalid answer: "it looked cool". GSAP everywhere because GSAP is available is amateur. Each ScrollTrigger, each marquee, each pinned section needs a reason. If you cannot articulate the reason in one sentence, drop the animation.
* **MARQUEE MAX-ONE-PER-PAGE (mandatory).** Horizontal scrolling text marquees ("logos endlessly scrolling", "manifesto scrolling sideways", "kinetic word strip") are appropriate at most ONCE per page. Two or more marquees on the same page reads as lazy filler. Pick the one section where the marquee actually serves the content; the others get a different layout.
* **GSAP Sticky-Stack Pattern (when scroll-stack is used).** A "card stack on scroll" must be a REAL sticky-stack, not a sequential reveal list. See Section 5.A below for the canonical code skeleton. Common failure: trigger fires halfway through scroll instead of pinning at viewport top. Fix: `start: "top top"` not `start: "top center"` or `"top 80%"`.
* **GSAP Horizontal-Pan Pattern (when horizontal scroll-hijack is used).** See Section 5.B below for the canonical skeleton. Common failure: animation starts before the section is pinned, so the user sees half a slide. Same fix: `start: "top top"`, pin the wrapper, scrub the inner track.

###### 5.A Sticky-Stack - Canonical Skeleton

```tsx
"use client";
import { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { gsap } from "gsap";
import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";
import { useReducedMotion } from "motion/react";

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

export function StickyStack({ cards }: { cards: React.ReactNode[] }) {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const reduce = useReducedMotion();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (reduce || !ref.current) return;
    const ctx = gsap.context(() => {
      const cardEls = gsap.utils.toArray<HTMLElement>(".stack-card");
      cardEls.forEach((card, i) => {
        if (i === cardEls.length - 1) return;
        ScrollTrigger.create({
          trigger: card,
          start: "top top",                              // pin at viewport top
          endTrigger: cardEls[cardEls.length - 1],
          end: "top top",
          pin: true,
          pinSpacing: false,
        });
        gsap.to(card, {
          scale: 0.92,
          opacity: 0.55,
          ease: "none",
          scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: cardEls[i + 1],
            start: "top bottom",
            end: "top top",
            scrub: true,
          },
        });
      });
    }, ref);
    return () => ctx.revert();
  }, [reduce]);

  return (
    <div ref={ref} className="relative">
      {cards.map((card, i) => (
        <div
          key={i}
          className="stack-card sticky top-0 min-h-[100dvh] flex items-center justify-center"
        >
          {card}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Critical points: `start: "top top"`, `pin: true`, every card except the last is pinned, the scale/opacity transform is driven by the NEXT card's scroll trigger (so previous card shrinks as next one arrives).

###### 5.B Horizontal-Pan - Canonical Skeleton

```tsx
"use client";
import { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { gsap } from "gsap";
import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";
import { useReducedMotion } from "motion/react";

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);

export function HorizontalPan({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const wrap = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const track = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const reduce = useReducedMotion();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (reduce || !wrap.current || !track.current) return;
    const ctx = gsap.context(() => {
      const distance = track.current!.scrollWidth - window.innerWidth;
      gsap.to(track.current, {
        x: -distance,
        ease: "none",
        scrollTrigger: {
          trigger: wrap.current,
          start: "top top",                              // pin starts when section top hits viewport top
          end: () => `+=${distance}`,                    // scroll distance = track width minus viewport
          pin: true,
          scrub: 1,
          invalidateOnRefresh: true,
        },
      });
    }, wrap);
    return () => ctx.revert();
  }, [reduce]);

  return (
    <section ref={wrap} className="relative overflow-hidden">
      <div ref={track} className="flex h-[100dvh] items-center">
        {children}
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

Critical points: `start: "top top"`, `pin: true`, `end: "+=${distance}"` (scroll length = horizontal travel needed), `scrub: 1`. The wrapper is pinned, the inner track slides horizontally as the user scrolls vertically.

###### 5.C Scroll-Reveal Stagger - Canonical Skeleton (lighter alternative)

For simple "items appear as they enter viewport" (no pinning), prefer Motion's `whileInView` over GSAP - lighter, no ScrollTrigger needed:

```tsx
"use client";
import { motion, useReducedMotion } from "motion/react";

export function RevealStagger({ items }: { items: string[] }) {
  const reduce = useReducedMotion();
  return (
    <ul className="grid gap-6">
      {items.map((item, i) => (
        <motion.li
          key={item}
          initial={reduce ? false : { opacity: 0, y: 24 }}
          whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
          transition={{
            duration: 0.6,
            delay: i * 0.06,
            ease: [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1],
          }}
        >
          {item}
        </motion.li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Use this for: feature lists, testimonial grids, logo walls, anything that just needs "enter on scroll." Save GSAP for actual pin/scrub work.

###### 5.D Forbidden Animation Patterns

* **`window.addEventListener("scroll", ...)`** is banned. It runs on every scroll frame, jank-prone, no batching. Use Motion's `useScroll()`, GSAP's `ScrollTrigger`, IntersectionObserver, or CSS `scroll-driven animations` (`animation-timeline: view()`).
* **Custom scroll progress calculations using `window.scrollY`** in React state. Same reason. Re-renders on every frame.
* **`requestAnimationFrame` loops that touch React state.** Use motion values (`useMotionValue` + `useTransform`) instead.
* **Layout Transitions:** Use Motion's `layout` and `layoutId` props for visible state changes (re-ordering lists, expanding modals, shared elements between routes). Do not wrap static content in `layout` props "for safety" - it costs measurement work.
* **Staggered Orchestration:** Use `staggerChildren` (Motion) or CSS cascade (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 100ms)`) for reveal moments where sequence matters. For `staggerChildren`, parent (`variants`) and children MUST share the same Client Component tree.

---

##### 6. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY GUARDRAILS

###### 6.A Hardware Acceleration
* Animate ONLY `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`.
* Use `will-change: transform` sparingly - only on elements that will actually animate.

###### 6.B Reduced Motion (mandatory)
* **Any motion above `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3` MUST honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.** This is non-negotiable.
* In Motion: wrap with `useReducedMotion()` and degrade to static.
* In CSS: gate animations behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or provide an override block under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` that disables.
* Infinite loops, parallax, scroll-hijack, and magnetic physics MUST collapse to static / instant under reduced motion.

###### 6.C Dark Mode (mandatory for any consumer-facing page)
* Design for **both modes from the start**. Never ship light-only or dark-only without explicit user instruction.
* Use Tailwind `dark:` variant OR CSS variables for tokens. Pick one strategy per project.
* **Do not prescribe specific dark-mode colors here.** The brief decides. Maintain visual hierarchy, brand identity, and WCAG AA contrast (AAA for body) across both modes.
* Respect `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Default to system preference unless the brand insists on one mode.

###### 6.D Core Web Vitals Targets
* **LCP** < 2.5s. Hero image must be `next/image priority` or preloaded.
* **INP** < 200ms. Heavy work off main thread.
* **CLS** < 0.1. Reserve space for images, fonts, embeds.
* Run Lighthouse before declaring a page done.

###### 6.E DOM Cost
* Apply grain / noise filters EXCLUSIVELY to fixed, `pointer-events-none` pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-[60] pointer-events-none`). NEVER on scrolling containers - continuous GPU repaints destroy mobile FPS.
* Be aware of bundle size. Motion is not tiny. Three.js is large. Lazy-load anything that's not above-the-fold.

###### 6.F Z-Index Restraint
NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10`. Use z-index strictly for systemic layer contexts (sticky navbars, modals, overlays, grain). Document the z-index scale in a project constants file.

---

##### 7. DIAL DEFINITIONS (Technical Reference)

###### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Predictable):** Symmetrical CSS Grid (12-col, equal fr-units), equal paddings, centered alignment.
* **4-7 (Offset):** `margin-top: -2rem` overlaps, varied image aspect ratios (4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
* **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (`grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`).
* **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, asymmetric layouts above `md:` MUST collapse to strict single-column (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px`.

###### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only. `prefers-reduced-motion` is the default mode anyway.
* **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus on `transform` and `opacity`.
* **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals, parallax, scroll-driven animation (CSS `animation-timeline` or GSAP ScrollTrigger). Use Motion hooks. **NEVER use `window.addEventListener('scroll')`** - it is a hard ban, not a "prefer-not." See Section 5.D for the allowed alternatives.

###### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Art Gallery):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps (`py-32` to `py-48`). Expensive, clean.
* **4-7 (Daily App):** Standard web app spacing (`py-16` to `py-24`).
* **8-10 (Cockpit):** Tight paddings. No card boxes; 1px lines separate data. Mandatory: `font-mono` for all numbers.

---

##### 8. DARK MODE PROTOCOL

Dual-mode by default. Never assume light-only unless the brief is print-emulating editorial.

###### 8.A Token Strategy (pick one, stick to it)
* **Tailwind `dark:` variant** (default for utility-first projects): every color utility paired with its dark variant (`bg-white dark:bg-zinc-950`, `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`).
* **CSS variables** (for shadcn/ui, Radix Themes, or component libraries with theming): define semantic tokens (`--surface`, `--surface-elevated`, `--text-primary`, `--accent`) and swap values under `[data-theme="dark"]` or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

###### 8.B Do Not Prescribe Specific Colors Here
The brief and brand decide. This skill enforces only:
* **Contrast** - WCAG AA minimum for body text, AAA target for hero copy.
* **Hierarchy parity** - visual hierarchy that works in light must work in dark. If a CTA pops in light, it pops in dark.
* **Brand fidelity** - primary brand color stays recognisable. Don't desaturate the brand into a dark mode.
* **No pure `#000000` and no pure `#ffffff`** - use off-black (zinc-950, near-black warm gray) and off-white. Pure values kill depth.

###### 8.C Default Mode
Respect `prefers-color-scheme` unless the brand insists. Add a manual toggle if either mode would lose key brand expression.

###### 8.D Test in Both Modes Before Finishing
Open the page in both modes during development. Do not ship a page you've only seen in one mode.

---

##### 9. AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)

Avoid these signatures unless the brief explicitly asks for them.

###### 9.A Visual & CSS
* **NO neon / outer glows** by default. Use inner borders or subtle tinted shadows.
* **NO pure black (`#000000`).** Off-black, zinc-950, or charcoal.
* **NO oversaturated accents.** Desaturate to blend with neutrals.
* **NO excessive gradient text** for large headers.
* **NO custom mouse cursors.** Outdated, accessibility-hostile, perf-hostile.

###### 9.B Typography
* **AVOID Inter as default.** See Section 4.1. Override path exists.
* **NO oversized H1s** that just scream. Control hierarchy with weight + color, not raw scale.
* **Serif constraints:** Serif for editorial / luxury / publication. Not for dashboards.

###### 9.C Layout & Spacing
* **Mathematically perfect** padding and margins. No floating elements with awkward gaps.
* **NO 3-column equal feature cards.** The generic "three identical cards horizontally" feature row is banned. Use 2-column zig-zag, asymmetric grid, scroll-pinned, or horizontal-scroll alternative.

###### 9.D Content & Data ("Jane Doe" Effect)
* **NO generic names.** "John Doe", "Sarah Chan", "Jack Su" → use creative, realistic, locale-appropriate names.
* **NO generic avatars.** No SVG "egg" or Lucide user icons → use believable photo placeholders or specific styling.
* **NO fake-perfect numbers.** Avoid `99.99%`, `50%`, `1234567`. Use organic, messy data (`47.2%`, `+1 (312) 847-1928`).
* **NO startup-slop brand names.** "Acme", "Nexus", "SmartFlow", "Cloudly" → invent contextual, premium names that sound real.
* **NO filler verbs.** "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen", "Revolutionize" → concrete verbs only.

###### 9.E External Resources & Components
* **NO hand-rolled SVG icons.** Use Phosphor / HugeIcons / Radix / Tabler. Lucide on explicit request only.
* **Hand-rolled decorative SVGs strongly discouraged** as default (see Section 4.8).
* **NO div-based fake screenshots.** Never build a fake product UI out of `<div>` rectangles to simulate a screenshot. Use real images, generated images, or skip the preview.
* **NO broken Unsplash links.** Use `https://picsum.photos/seed/{descriptive-string}/{w}/{h}`, or generated photo placeholders, or actual assets.
* **shadcn/ui customization:** Allowed, but NEVER in default state. Customize radii, colors, shadows, typography to the project aesthetic.
* **Production-Ready Cleanliness:** Code visually clean, memorable, meticulously refined.

###### 9.F Production-Test Tells (banned outright)

These patterns came out of real LLM-generated landing-page tests. They are the signatures the model defaults to when it tries to "look designed." Treat them as hard bans unless the brief explicitly calls for one.

**Hero & top-of-page**
* **NO version labels in the hero.** `V0.6`, `v2.0`, `BETA`, `INVITE-ONLY PREVIEW`, `EARLY ACCESS`, `ALPHA` - banned as default eyebrows. Only acceptable when the brief is explicitly about a product launch / preview status.
* **NO "Brand · No. 01"-style sub-eyebrows.** "Marrow · No. 01 · The 6-quart" type micro-meta lines. Skip them.

**Section numbering & micro-labels**
* **NO section-number eyebrows.** `00 / INDEX`, `001 · Capabilities`, `002 · Featured commission`, `06 · how it works`, `05 · The honest table` - banned. Eyebrows should name the topic in plain language, not enumerate.
* **NO `01 / 4`-style pagination on images or bento tiles.** If the user can count, they don't need the label.
* **NO `Scroll · 001 Capabilities`-style scroll cues.** A simple arrow or "Scroll" is enough; no section-number prefix.
* **NO "Index of Work, 2018 - 2026"-style range labels** as eyebrows. Just say what the section is.

**Separators & dots**
* **The middle-dot (`·`) is rationed.** Maximum 1 per line in metadata strips. Do NOT use it as the default separator for everything ("foo · bar · baz · qux · quux"). If you need a separator family, prefer line breaks, hairlines, or columns.
* **NO decorative colored status dots on every list/nav/badge.** A colored dot before "ONE Q4 SLOT OPEN" or before every nav link, or every task row - banned by default. Acceptable only when the dot conveys actual semantic state (a server status, an availability flag) and is used sparingly.

**Em-dashes & typography flourishes**
* **NO em-dash (`—`) as a design element OR anywhere else.** See Section 9.G below for the complete, non-negotiable ban. The em-dash character is forbidden in headlines, eyebrows, pills, body copy, quotes, attribution, captions, button text, and alt text. Use the regular hyphen (`-`).
* **NO `<br>`-broken-and-italicized headlines** as a default "design move." "for thirty\<br\>*years.*" type splits. Headlines should read naturally first, get clever only when the brief demands it.
* **NO vertical rotated text** ("INDEX OF WORK, 2018 - 2026" rotated 90°). Agency-portfolio cliché. Use it only when the brief is explicitly agency / Awwwards / experimental AND it serves a real composition purpose.
* **NO crosshair / hairline grid lines as decoration.** Vertical and horizontal lines drawn just to make the page "feel designed" - banned. Use them only when they organize real content.

**Fake product previews**
* **NO div-based fake product UI in the hero** (fake task list, fake terminal, fake dashboard built from styled divs). It is the #1 LLM-design Tell. Use a real screenshot, a generated image, a real component preview, or none at all.
* **NO fake version footers** ("v0.6.2-rc.1", "last sync 4s ago · main") inside fake screenshots. Adds nothing, screams AI.

**Marketing-copy Tells**
* **NO "Quietly in use at" / "Quietly trusted by"** social-proof headers. Use natural language: "Trusted by", "Used at", "Customers include", or skip the heading entirely if the logos speak.
* **NO "From the field" / "Field notes" / "Currently on the bench" / "On our desks" / "Loose plates" style poetic labels** on quote, blog, or sidebar sections. Reads as performative-craftsman. Use plain functional labels ("Testimonials", "Latest writing", "Now working on") or skip the label.
* **NO "We respect the French ones"-style** mock-humble industry-references in body copy. Cute and AI-y.
* **NO weather / locale strips** ("LIS 14:23 · 18°C") in headers/footers unless the brief is explicitly about a place / time-zone-distributed studio.
* **NO micro-meta-sentences under eyebrows.** Sentences like *"Each of these is a feature we ship today, not a roadmap promise. The list will stay short on purpose."* sitting under a section heading are clutter. Eyebrow + Headline + Body is enough.
* **NO generic step labels.** "Stage 1 / Stage 2 / Stage 3", "Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3", "Phase 01 / Phase 02 / Phase 03", "Pass One / Pass Two / Pass Three". Banned. The actual step content is the label. If you must show progression, use the verb-noun directly ("Install", "Configure", "Ship") not "Stage 1: Install".

**Pills, labels and version stamps**
* **NO pills/labels/tags overlaid on images.** No `<span>` overlays on photos with tags like `Brand · 02`, `PLATE · BRAND`, `Field notes - journal`. Either let the image speak alone, or add a caption directly below (outside the image).
* **NO photo-credit captions as decoration.** Strings like `Field study no. 12 · Ines Caetano`, `Plate 03 · House archive`, `Frame XII · 35mm` under stock/picsum images are pretentious. Photo credit is allowed ONLY when there is a real photographer being credited for a real photo (with permission). Otherwise: skip the caption or use a one-line functional caption ("The 6-quart, in Sage.").
* **NO version footers on marketing pages.** Footer strings like `v1.4.2`, `Build 0048`, `last sync 4s ago · main` are CLI / devtool fixtures, not landing-page content. Banned on marketing/landing/portfolio pages.
* **NO "Reservation 412 of 800"-style live-stock counters** as decoration. Only if the brief is explicitly a limited-run waitlist with real data.

**Decoration text strips**
* **NO decoration text strip at hero bottom.** Patterns like `BRAND. MOTION. SPATIAL.`, `TYPE / FORM / MOTION`, `DESIGN · BUILD · SHIP`, `ESTD. 2018 · LISBON · BRAND. MOTION. SPATIAL.` as a small mono-caps strip across the bottom of the hero are an agency-portfolio cliché. Banned by default. Only acceptable when the strip carries real, navigable links (sticky bottom nav) or real status info (cookie banner, build info on a docs site).
* **NO floating top-right sub-text in section headings.** Pattern: section has a giant left-aligned headline; in the top-right corner of the same section header there is a small explainer paragraph floating with no clear alignment to anything else. That floater is the Tell. Either put the sub-text directly under the headline, or build a clean 2-column header (left: headline, right: aligned body), but not a tiny corner paragraph.

**Lists, dividers and scoring**
* **NO `border-t` + `border-b` on every row of a long list / spec table.** Pick one (bottom-border between rows OR top-border above the group) and use it sparsely. A 10-row spec table with hairlines under each row is the laziest layout - see Section 4.9 for alternative UI components.
* **NO scoring/progress bars with filled background tracks** as comparison visuals. If you need to show "X out of Y" comparisons, prefer a number + small icon, or a tiny inline bar WITHOUT a background track. Big filled `bg-zinc-200` tracks with a partial fill on top are dashboard-UI clutter on a landing page.

**Locale, time, scroll cues**
* **Locale / city-name / time / weather strips are banned for 99% of briefs.** "Lisbon, working with founders" in the hero, "1200-690 Lisbon, Portugal" in the footer, "Lisbon 14:23 · 18°C" in the nav. These are agency-portfolio decoration tells. Allowed ONLY when: the brief explicitly describes a globally-distributed studio with timezone-relevant work, OR a travel-focused brand, OR a real-world physical venue. A single contact-address mention in the footer is fine; an atmospheric locale strip is not.
* **Scroll cues are banned.** `Scroll`, `↓ scroll`, `Scroll to explore`, `Scroll to walk through it`, animated mouse-wheel icons. If the user has not scrolled yet, they are looking at the hero. They know what scroll is. The bottom of the viewport does not need a label.
* **ZERO decorative status dots by default.** A coloured dot before nav items, before list rows, before badges, before status labels is a Tell. Only acceptable when conveying real semantic state (a live indicator on actual server status, a live availability flag) and limited to one per page section.

###### 9.G EM-DASH BAN (the single most-violated Tell)

**Em-dash (`—`) is COMPLETELY banned.** It is the LLM's signature stylistic crutch and it is the #1 visual Tell in production tests. There is no "limited use" allowance, no "natural language frequency" allowance, no "in body copy is fine" allowance. None.

* **Banned in headlines.** Use a period or a comma.
* **Banned in eyebrows / labels / pills / button text / image captions / nav items.** Replace with line breaks, columns, or hairlines.
* **Banned in body copy.** Restructure the sentence: two sentences with a period, OR a comma, OR parentheses, OR a colon.
* **Banned in quote attribution.** Use a normal hyphen with spaces (` - `) or a line break + smaller-weight name.
* **Banned in en-dash form too (`–`) when used as a separator.** Date ranges (`2018-2026`) use a hyphen. Number ranges (`€40-80k`) use a hyphen.

The ONLY permitted dash characters on the page are:
* Regular hyphen `-` (for compound words, ranges, line dividers in markup)
* Minus sign in math (`-5°C`)

If your output contains a single `—` or `–` anywhere visible to the user, the output fails the Pre-Flight Check and must be rewritten.

This rule is non-negotiable. The agent has historically ignored em-dash limits when phrased as "use sparingly." The phrasing here is binary: zero em-dashes.

##### 10. REFERENCE VOCABULARY (Pattern Names the Agent Should Know)

This is a vocabulary, not a library. The agent should KNOW these pattern names to communicate about them, design with them in mind, and reach for them when the design read calls for them. **Implementations and code sketches live in the Block Library (Section 12), which is populated iteratively.**

###### Hero Paradigms
* **Asymmetric Split Hero** - Text on one side, asset on the other, generous white space.
* **Editorial Manifesto Hero** - Large type, no asset, almost-poster.
* **Video / Media Mask Hero** - Type cut out as mask over video background.
* **Kinetic-Type Hero** - Animated typography as the primary visual.
* **Curtain-Reveal Hero** - Hero parts on scroll like a curtain.
* **Scroll-Pinned Hero** - Hero stays pinned while content scrolls behind.

###### Navigation & Menus
* **Mac OS Dock Magnification** - Edge nav, icons scale fluidly on hover.
* **Magnetic Button** - Pulls toward cursor.
* **Gooey Menu** - Sub-items detach like viscous liquid.
* **Dynamic Island** - Morphing pill for status / alerts.
* **Contextual Radial Menu** - Circular menu expanding at click point.
* **Floating Speed Dial** - FAB springing into curved secondary actions.
* **Mega Menu Reveal** - Full-screen dropdown, stagger-fade content.

###### Layout & Grids
* **Bento Grid** - Asymmetric tile grouping (Apple Control Center).
* **Masonry Layout** - Staggered grid, no fixed row height.
* **Chroma Grid** - Borders / tiles with subtle animating gradients.
* **Split-Screen Scroll** - Two halves sliding in opposite directions.
* **Sticky-Stack Sections** - Sections that pin and stack on scroll.

###### Cards & Containers
* **Parallax Tilt Card** - 3D tilt tracking mouse coordinates.
* **Spotlight Border Card** - Borders illuminate under cursor.
* **Glassmorphism Panel** - Frosted glass with inner refraction.
* **Holographic Foil Card** - Iridescent rainbow shift on hover.
* **Tinder Swipe Stack** - Physical card stack, swipe-away.
* **Morphing Modal** - Button expands into its own dialog.

###### Scroll Animations
* **Sticky Scroll Stack** - Cards stick and physically stack.
* **Horizontal Scroll Hijack** - Vertical scroll → horizontal pan.
* **Locomotive / Sequence Scroll** - Video / 3D sequence tied to scrollbar.
* **Zoom Parallax** - Central background image zooming on scroll.
* **Scroll Progress Path** - SVG line drawing along scroll.
* **Liquid Swipe Transition** - Page transition like viscous liquid.

###### Galleries & Media
* **Dome Gallery** - 3D panoramic gallery.
* **Coverflow Carousel** - 3D carousel with angled edges.
* **Drag-to-Pan Grid** - Boundless draggable canvas.
* **Accordion Image Slider** - Narrow strips expanding on hover.
* **Hover Image Trail** - Mouse leaves popping image trail.
* **Glitch Effect Image** - RGB-channel shift on hover.

###### Typography & Text
* **Kinetic Marquee** - Endless text bands reversing on scroll.
* **Text Mask Reveal** - Massive type as transparent window to video.
* **Text Scramble Effect** - Matrix-style decoding on load / hover.
* **Circular Text Path** - Text curving along spinning circle.
* **Gradient Stroke Animation** - Outlined text with running gradient.
* **Kinetic Typography Grid** - Letters dodging the cursor.

###### Micro-Interactions & Effects
* **Particle Explosion Button** - CTA shatters into particles on success.
* **Liquid Pull-to-Refresh** - Reload indicator like detaching droplets.
* **Skeleton Shimmer** - Shifting light reflection across placeholders.
* **Directional Hover-Aware Button** - Fill enters from cursor's exact side.
* **Ripple Click Effect** - Wave from click coordinates.
* **Animated SVG Line Drawing** - Vectors drawing themselves in real time.
* **Mesh Gradient Background** - Organic lava-lamp blobs.
* **Lens Blur Depth** - Background UI blurred to focus foreground action.

###### Animation Library Choice
* **Motion (`motion/react`)** - default for UI / Bento / state-change motion.
* **GSAP + ScrollTrigger** - for full-page scrolltelling and scroll hijacks. Isolate in dedicated leaf components with `useEffect` cleanup.
* **Three.js / WebGL** - for canvas backgrounds and 3D scenes. Same isolation rule.
* **NEVER mix GSAP / Three.js with Motion in the same component tree.** They fight over the same frames.

---

##### 11. REDESIGN PROTOCOL

This skill handles **greenfield builds AND redesigns**. Misclassifying the mode is the single biggest source of bad redesign output.

###### 11.A Detect the Mode (first action)
* **Greenfield** - no existing site, or full overhaul approved. Dial baseline from Section 1.
* **Redesign - Preserve** - modernise without breaking the brand. Audit first, extract brand tokens, evolve gradually.
* **Redesign - Overhaul** - new visual language on top of existing content. Treat as greenfield for visuals; preserve content and IA.

If ambiguous, ask **once**: *"Should this redesign preserve the existing brand, or are we starting visually from scratch?"*

###### 11.B Audit Before Touching
Document the current state before proposing changes:
* **Brand tokens** - primary / accent colors, type stack, logo treatment, radii.
* **Information architecture** - page tree, primary nav, key conversion paths.
* **Content blocks** - what exists, what's doing work, what's filler.
* **Patterns to preserve** - signature interactions, recognisable hero, copy voice.
* **Patterns to retire** - AI-slop tells, broken layouts, dead links, generic stock imagery, perf traps.
* **Dial reading of the existing site** - infer current `DESIGN_VARIANCE` / `MOTION_INTENSITY` / `VISUAL_DENSITY`. That's your starting point, not the baseline.
* **SEO baseline** - current ranking pages, meta titles, structured data, OG cards. **SEO migration is the #1 redesign risk.**

###### 11.C Preservation Rules
* **Do not change information architecture** unless asked. Keep page slugs, anchor IDs, primary nav labels stable for SEO and muscle memory.
* **Extract brand colors before applying Section 4.2.** A brand that is already purple stays purple - apply the LILA RULE's override.
* **Preserve copy voice** unless asked for a rewrite. Visual modernisation ≠ content rewrite.
* **Honor existing accessibility wins.** Do not regress focus states, alt text, keyboard nav, contrast.
* **Respect existing analytics events.** Do not rename buttons, form fields, section IDs that downstream tracking depends on.

###### 11.D Modernisation Levers (priority order)
Apply in order - stop when the brief is satisfied:
1. **Typography refresh** - biggest visual lift per unit of risk.
2. **Spacing & rhythm** - increase section padding, fix vertical rhythm.
3. **Color recalibration** - desaturate, unify neutrals, keep brand accent.
4. **Motion layer** - add `MOTION_INTENSITY`-appropriate micro-interactions to existing components.
5. **Hero & key-section recomposition** - restructure top-of-funnel using Section 10 vocabulary.
6. **Full block replacement** - only when the existing block is unsalvageable.

###### 11.E Decision Tree: Targeted Evolution vs Full Redesign
* IA, content, and SEO sound → **targeted evolution** (Levers 1-4). ~70% of value at ~40% of risk.
* Visual debt is structural (broken IA, no design system, broken mobile) → **full redesign** with strict content preservation.
* Brand itself is changing → **greenfield**.

###### 11.F What Never Changes Silently
Never modify without explicit user approval:
* URL structure / route slugs.
* Primary nav labels.
* Form field names or order (breaks analytics + autofill).
* Brand logo or wordmark.
* Existing legal / consent / cookie copy.

---

##### 12. THE BLOCK LIBRARY (Contract - Implementations Land Here Iteratively)

The Reference Vocabulary (Section 10) names patterns. The Block Library implements them with real props, real motion specs, and real code sketches.

**Status:** schema defined here. Blocks will be added iteratively. Do not freelance new blocks without following this schema.

###### 12.A File Location
```
skills/taste-skill/blocks/
  hero/
    asymmetric-split.md
    editorial-manifesto.md
    kinetic-type.md
    ...
  feature/
    bento-grid.md
    sticky-scroll-stack.md
    zig-zag.md
    ...
  social-proof/
  pricing/
  cta/
  footer/
  navigation/
  portfolio/
  transition/
```

###### 12.B Required Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: asymmetric-split-hero
category: hero
dial_compatibility:
  variance: [6, 10]
  motion: [3, 10]
  density: [2, 5]
when_to_use: "Landing pages with one strong asset and one strong message. Default hero for SaaS, agency, premium consumer."
not_for: "Editorial / manifesto launches where the message IS the design."
stack: ["react", "next", "tailwind", "motion"]
---
```

###### 12.C Required Body Sections
1. **Visual sketch** - short ASCII or description of the layout.
2. **Props API** - the component's interface.
3. **Code sketch** - minimal working implementation (Server Component default, Client island for motion).
4. **Mobile fallback** - explicit collapse rules for `< 768px`.
5. **Motion variants** - one variant per `MOTION_INTENSITY` band (1-3, 4-7, 8-10). Reduced-motion fallback explicit.
6. **Dark-mode notes** - token strategy specific to this block.
7. **Anti-patterns** - common ways this block goes wrong.
8. **References** - links to real examples in production.

###### 12.D Block-Library Discipline
* One block per file. No multi-block files.
* Every block must work standalone (drop it into a page, it renders).
* Every block must pass the Pre-Flight Check (Section 14).
* Blocks that depend on a design system from Section 2.A live under `blocks/<category>/<name>--<system>.md` (e.g. `feature/bento-grid--material.md`).

---

##### 13. OUT OF SCOPE

This skill is NOT for:
* Dashboards / dense product UI / admin panels (use Fluent, Carbon, Atlassian, or Polaris from Section 2.A).
* Data tables (use TanStack Table or AG Grid).
* Multi-step forms / wizards (use Form-specific patterns; this skill won't make them better).
* Code editors (use Monaco / CodeMirror with their official skinning).
* Native mobile (use Apple HIG / Material directly).
* Realtime collab UIs (presence, cursors, OT-aware - different problem class).

If the brief is one of the above, **say so explicitly**, point to the right tool, and only apply this skill's marketing-page / about-page / landing-page parts to the surfaces where they apply.

---

##### 14. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK

Run this matrix before outputting code. This is the last filter.

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. Run every box. If any box fails, the output is not done.**

- [ ] **Brief inference** declared (Section 0.B one-liner)?
- [ ] **Dial values** explicit and reasoned from the brief, not silently using baseline?
- [ ] **Design system** chosen from Section 2 if applicable, or aesthetic labeled honestly?
- [ ] **Redesign mode** detected and audit performed (if applicable, Section 11)?
- [ ] **ZERO em-dashes (`—`) anywhere on the page.** Headlines, eyebrows, pills, body, quotes, attribution, captions, buttons, alt text. Zero. (Section 9.G - non-negotiable.)
- [ ] **Page Theme Lock**: ONE theme (light, dark, or auto) for the whole page. No section flips to inverted mode mid-page (Section 4.11)?
- [ ] **Color Consistency Lock**: one accent color used identically across all sections (Section 4.2)?
- [ ] **Shape Consistency Lock**: one corner-radius system applied consistently (Section 4.4)?
- [ ] **Button Contrast Check**: every CTA text is readable against its background (no white-on-white, WCAG AA 4.5:1)?
- [ ] **CTA Button Wrap**: no CTA label wraps to 2+ lines at desktop?
- [ ] **Form Contrast Check**: form inputs, placeholders, focus rings, labels all pass WCAG AA against the section background?
- [ ] **Serif discipline**: if a serif is used, it is NOT Fraunces or Instrument_Serif (or it is, with explicit brand justification)? Different serif from your previous project?
- [ ] **Premium-consumer palette check**: if the brief is premium-consumer (cookware / wellness / artisan / luxury), the palette is NOT the AI-default beige+brass+oxblood+espresso family? Different family from your previous premium-consumer project?
- [ ] **Italic descender clearance**: every italic word with `y g j p q` has `leading-[1.1]` min + `pb-1` reserve?
- [ ] **Hero fits the viewport**: headline ≤ 2 lines, subtext ≤ 20 words AND ≤ 4 lines, CTA visible without scroll, font scale planned around image?
- [ ] **Hero top padding**: max `pt-24` at desktop, hero content does not float halfway down the viewport?
- [ ] **Hero stack discipline**: max 4 text elements in hero (eyebrow OR brand strip, headline, subtext, CTAs)? No tiny tagline below CTAs, no trust micro-strip in hero?
- [ ] **EYEBROW COUNT (mechanical)**: count instances of `uppercase tracking` micro-labels above section headlines across all components. Count ≤ ceil(sectionCount / 3)? Hero counts as 1.
- [ ] **Split-Header Ban**: no "left big headline + right small explainer paragraph" pattern as a section header (vertical stack instead)?
- [ ] **Zigzag Alternation Cap**: no 3+ consecutive sections with the same image+text-split layout?
- [ ] **No Duplicate CTA Intent**: no two CTAs with the same intent ("Get in touch" + "Let's talk" both on page = Fail)?
- [ ] **Logo wall = logo only**: no industry / category labels printed below logos?
- [ ] **Bento Background Diversity**: at least 2-3 bento cells have real visual variation (image, gradient, pattern), not all white-on-white text cards?
- [ ] **"Used by / Trusted by" logo wall** lives UNDER the hero, not inside it, uses REAL SVG logos (Simple Icons / devicon) or generated SVG marks, NOT plain text wordmarks?
- [ ] **Copy Self-Audit**: every visible string re-read, no grammatically-broken or AI-hallucinated phrases ("free on its past" type) shipped?
- [ ] **Motion motivated**: every animation can be justified in one sentence (hierarchy / storytelling / feedback / state transition), no GSAP-for-show?
- [ ] **Marquee max-one-per-page**: no two horizontal marquees on the same page?
- [ ] **Navigation on ONE line** at desktop, height ≤ 80px?
- [ ] **Section-Layout-Repetition** check: no two sections share the same layout family (at least 4 different families across 8 sections)?
- [ ] **Bento has rhythm AND exact cell count** (N items → N cells, no empty cells in middle or at end)?
- [ ] **Long lists use the right UI component** (not default `<ul>` with `divide-y` for > 5 items - see Section 4.9 alternatives)?
- [ ] **Real images used** (gen-tool first, then Picsum-seed, then explicit placeholder slots) - NO div-based fake screenshots, NO hand-rolled decorative SVGs, NO pure-text minimalism?
- [ ] **No pills/labels overlaid on images** (no `Plate · Brand`, no `Field notes - journal`)?
- [ ] **No photo-credit captions as decoration** (`Field study no. 12 · Ines Caetano`)?
- [ ] **No version footers** (`v1.4.2`, `Build 0048`) on marketing pages?
- [ ] **No micro-meta-sentences** under eyebrows ("Each of these is a feature we ship today...")?
- [ ] **No decoration text strip at hero bottom** (`BRAND. MOTION. SPATIAL.`)?
- [ ] **No floating top-right sub-text** in section headings?
- [ ] **No scoring/progress bars with filled background tracks** as comparison visuals?
- [ ] **No locale / city-name / time / weather strips** unless brief is genuinely globally-distributed or place-focused?
- [ ] **No scroll cues** (`Scroll`, `↓ scroll`, `Scroll to explore`)?
- [ ] **No version labels in hero** (V0.6, BETA, INVITE-ONLY) unless the brief is a launch?
- [ ] **No section-numbering eyebrows** (`00 / INDEX`, `001 · Capabilities`, `06 · how it works`)?
- [ ] **No decorative dots** (zero by default, only for real semantic state)?
- [ ] **No `border-t` + `border-b` on every row** of long lists / spec tables?
- [ ] **Content density** sane: no 20-row data tables, no fake-precise specs without justification, ≤ 25-word sub-paragraphs by default?
- [ ] **Quotes ≤ 3 lines** of body, attribution clean (no em-dash)?
- [ ] **Motion claimed = motion shown**: if `MOTION_INTENSITY > 4`, page actually animates, not just claimed?
- [ ] **GSAP sticky-stack / horizontal-pan** implemented per Section 5.A / 5.B canonical skeleton (`start: "top top"`, `pin: true`, correct scrub)?
- [ ] **No `window.addEventListener('scroll')`** - using Motion `useScroll()` / ScrollTrigger / IntersectionObserver / CSS scroll-driven animations only?
- [ ] **Reduced motion** wrapped for everything `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3`?
- [ ] **Dark mode** tokens defined and tested in both modes?
- [ ] **Mobile collapse** explicit (`w-full`, `px-4`, `max-w-7xl mx-auto`) for high-variance layouts?
- [ ] **Viewport stability**: `min-h-[100dvh]`, never `h-screen`?
- [ ] **`useEffect` animations** have strict cleanup functions?
- [ ] **Empty / loading / error** states provided?
- [ ] **Cards omitted** in favor of spacing where possible?
- [ ] **Icons** from an allowed library only (Phosphor / HugeIcons / Radix / Tabler), no hand-rolled SVG paths?
- [ ] **Motion** isolated in client-leaf components with `'use client'` at the top, memoized?
- [ ] **No AI Tells** from Section 9 (Inter as default, AI-purple, three-equal cards, Jane Doe, Acme, "Quietly in use at")?
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals** plausibly hit (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1)?
- [ ] **One design system** per project (no Material + shadcn mixed)?

If a single checkbox cannot be honestly ticked, the page is not done. Fix it before delivering.

##### Appendix C - Apple Liquid Glass: Honest Web Approximation

Do **not** treat random CSS snippets as official Apple Liquid Glass.

###### What is official
Apple documents Liquid Glass inside Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Developer Documentation for **Apple platforms**. It is a dynamic material used across Apple platform UI. Apple's native implementation belongs to Apple platform APIs and system components, **not a public web CSS package**.

Relevant official docs:
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines → Materials
- Apple Developer Documentation → Liquid Glass
- Apple Developer Documentation → Adopting Liquid Glass
- SwiftUI → Material

###### What is NOT official
There is no `liquid-glass.css` from Apple for normal websites.

A web approximation can use:
- `backdrop-filter`
- transparent backgrounds
- layered borders
- highlight overlays
- gradients
- motion
- strong contrast fallbacks

But that is **web glassmorphism / frosted-glass approximation**, not official Apple Liquid Glass. Label it as such in comments.

###### Safer web approximation skeleton

```css
.liquid-glass-web-approx {
  position: relative;

### design-taste-frontend-v1
**Description:** The original v1 taste-skill, preserved for projects depending on its exact behavior. The current default is `design-taste-frontend` (v2 experimental), which is a substantial rewrite. Use this v1 install name only if you need exact backward compatibility.


#### High-Agency Frontend Skill

##### 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION
* DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8 (1=Perfect Symmetry, 10=Artsy Chaos)
* MOTION_INTENSITY: 6 (1=Static/No movement, 10=Cinematic/Magic Physics)
* VISUAL_DENSITY: 4 (1=Art Gallery/Airy, 10=Pilot Cockpit/Packed Data)

**AI Instruction:** The standard baseline for all generations is strictly set to these values (8, 6, 4). Do not ask the user to edit this file. Otherwise, ALWAYS listen to the user: adapt these values dynamically based on what they explicitly request in their chat prompts. Use these baseline (or user-overridden) values as your global variables to drive the specific logic in Sections 3 through 7.

##### 2. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS
Unless the user explicitly specifies a different stack, adhere to these structural constraints to maintain consistency:

* **DEPENDENCY VERIFICATION [MANDATORY]:** Before importing ANY 3rd party library (e.g. `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `zustand`), you MUST check `package.json`. If the package is missing, you MUST output the installation command (e.g. `npm install package-name`) before providing the code. **Never** assume a library exists.
* **Framework & Interactivity:** React or Next.js. Default to Server Components (`RSC`). 
    * **RSC SAFETY:** Global state works ONLY in Client Components. In Next.js, wrap providers in a `"use client"` component.
    * **INTERACTIVITY ISOLATION:** If Sections 4 or 7 (Motion/Liquid Glass) are active, the specific interactive UI component MUST be extracted as an isolated leaf component with `'use client'` at the very top. Server Components must exclusively render static layouts.
* **State Management:** Use local `useState`/`useReducer` for isolated UI. Use global state strictly for deep prop-drilling avoidance.
* **Styling Policy:** Use Tailwind CSS (v3/v4) for 90% of styling. 
    * **TAILWIND VERSION LOCK:** Check `package.json` first. Do not use v4 syntax in v3 projects. 
    * **T4 CONFIG GUARD:** For v4, do NOT use `tailwindcss` plugin in `postcss.config.js`. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` or the Vite plugin.
* **ANTI-EMOJI POLICY [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use emojis in code, markup, text content, or alt text. Replace symbols with high-quality icons (Radix, Phosphor) or clean SVG primitives. Emojis are BANNED.
* **Responsiveness & Spacing:**
  * Standardize breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
  * Contain page layouts using `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or `max-w-7xl`.
  * **Viewport Stability [CRITICAL]:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent catastrophic layout jumping on mobile browsers (iOS Safari).
  * **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`) for reliable structures.
* **Icons:** You MUST use exactly `@phosphor-icons/react` or `@radix-ui/react-icons` as the import paths (check installed version). Standardize `strokeWidth` globally (e.g., exclusively use `1.5` or `2.0`).


##### 3. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)
LLMs have statistical biases toward specific UI cliché patterns. Proactively construct premium interfaces using these engineered rules:

**Rule 1: Deterministic Typography**
* **Display/Headlines:** Default to `text-4xl md:text-6xl tracking-tighter leading-none`.
    * **ANTI-SLOP:** Discourage `Inter` for "Premium" or "Creative" vibes. Force unique character using `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`.
    * **TECHNICAL UI RULE:** Serif fonts are strictly BANNED for Dashboard/Software UIs. For these contexts, use exclusively high-end Sans-Serif pairings (`Geist` + `Geist Mono` or `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`).
* **Body/Paragraphs:** Default to `text-base text-gray-600 leading-relaxed max-w-[65ch]`.

**Rule 2: Color Calibration**
* **Constraint:** Max 1 Accent Color. Saturation < 80%.
* **THE LILA BAN:** The "AI Purple/Blue" aesthetic is strictly BANNED. No purple button glows, no neon gradients. Use absolute neutral bases (Zinc/Slate) with high-contrast, singular accents (e.g. Emerald, Electric Blue, or Deep Rose).
* **COLOR CONSISTENCY:** Stick to one palette for the entire output. Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.

**Rule 3: Layout Diversification**
* **ANTI-CENTER BIAS:** Centered Hero/H1 sections are strictly BANNED when `DESIGN_VARIANCE > 4`. Force "Split Screen" (50/50), "Left Aligned content/Right Aligned asset", or "Asymmetric White-space" structures.

**Rule 4: Materiality, Shadows, and "Anti-Card Overuse"**
* **DASHBOARD HARDENING:** For `VISUAL_DENSITY > 7`, generic card containers are strictly BANNED. Use logic-grouping via `border-t`, `divide-y`, or purely negative space. Data metrics should breathe without being boxed in unless elevation (z-index) is functionally required.
* **Execution:** Use cards ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy. When a shadow is used, tint it to the background hue.

**Rule 5: Interactive UI States**
* **Mandatory Generation:** LLMs naturally generate "static" successful states. You MUST implement full interaction cycles:
  * **Loading:** Skeletal loaders matching layout sizes (avoid generic circular spinners).
  * **Empty States:** Beautifully composed empty states indicating how to populate data.
  * **Error States:** Clear, inline error reporting (e.g., forms).
  * **Tactile Feedback:** On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push indicating success/action.

**Rule 6: Data & Form Patterns**
* **Forms:** Label MUST sit above input. Helper text is optional but should exist in markup. Error text below input. Use a standard `gap-2` for input blocks.

##### 4. CREATIVE PROACTIVITY (Anti-Slop Implementation)
To actively combat generic AI designs, systematically implement these high-end coding concepts as your baseline:
* **"Liquid Glass" Refraction:** When glassmorphism is needed, go beyond `backdrop-blur`. Add a 1px inner border (`border-white/10`) and a subtle inner shadow (`shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1)]`) to simulate physical edge refraction.
* **Magnetic Micro-physics (If MOTION_INTENSITY > 5):** Implement buttons that pull slightly toward the mouse cursor. **CRITICAL:** NEVER use React `useState` for magnetic hover or continuous animations. Use EXCLUSIVELY Framer Motion's `useMotionValue` and `useTransform` outside the React render cycle to prevent performance collapse on mobile.
* **Perpetual Micro-Interactions:** When `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5`, embed continuous, infinite micro-animations (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer, Carousel) in standard components (avatars, status dots, backgrounds). Apply premium Spring Physics (`type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`) to all interactive elements—no linear easing.
* **Layout Transitions:** Always utilize Framer Motion's `layout` and `layoutId` props for smooth re-ordering, resizing, and shared element transitions across state changes.
* **Staggered Orchestration:** Do not mount lists or grids instantly. Use `staggerChildren` (Framer) or CSS cascade (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 100ms)`) to create sequential waterfall reveals. **CRITICAL:** For `staggerChildren`, the Parent (`variants`) and Children MUST reside in the identical Client Component tree. If data is fetched asynchronously, pass the data as props into a centralized Parent Motion wrapper.

##### 5. PERFORMANCE GUARDRAILS
* **DOM Cost:** Apply grain/noise filters exclusively to fixed, pointer-event-none pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-50 pointer-events-none`) and NEVER to scrolling containers to prevent continuous GPU repaints and mobile performance degradation.
* **Hardware Acceleration:** Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height`. Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`.
* **Z-Index Restraint:** NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10` unprompted. Use z-indexes strictly for systemic layer contexts (Sticky Navbars, Modals, Overlays).

##### 6. TECHNICAL REFERENCE (Dial Definitions)

###### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Predictable):** Flexbox `justify-center`, strict 12-column symmetrical grids, equal paddings.
* **4-7 (Offset):** Use `margin-top: -2rem` overlapping, varied image aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
* **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (e.g., `grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`). 
* **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, any asymmetric layout above `md:` MUST aggressively fall back to a strict, single-column layout (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px` to prevent horizontal scrolling and layout breakage.

###### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only.
* **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** Use `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. Use `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus strictly on `transform` and `opacity`. Use `will-change: transform` sparingly.
* **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals or parallax. Use Framer Motion hooks. NEVER use `window.addEventListener('scroll')`.

###### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Art Gallery Mode):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps. Everything feels very expensive and clean.
* **4-7 (Daily App Mode):** Normal spacing for standard web apps.
* **8-10 (Cockpit Mode):** Tiny paddings. No card boxes; just 1px lines to separate data. Everything is packed. **Mandatory:** Use Monospace (`font-mono`) for all numbers.

##### 7. AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)
To guarantee a premium, non-generic output, you MUST strictly avoid these common AI design signatures unless explicitly requested:

###### Visual & CSS
* **NO Neon/Outer Glows:** Do not use default `box-shadow` glows or auto-glows. Use inner borders or subtle tinted shadows.
* **NO Pure Black:** Never use `#000000`. Use Off-Black, Zinc-950, or Charcoal.
* **NO Oversaturated Accents:** Desaturate accents to blend elegantly with neutrals.
* **NO Excessive Gradient Text:** Do not use text-fill gradients for large headers.
* **NO Custom Mouse Cursors:** They are outdated and ruin performance/accessibility.

###### Typography
* **NO Inter Font:** Banned. Use `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`.
* **NO Oversized H1s:** The first heading should not scream. Control hierarchy with weight and color, not just massive scale.
* **Serif Constraints:** Use Serif fonts ONLY for creative/editorial designs. **NEVER** use Serif on clean Dashboards.

###### Layout & Spacing
* **Align & Space Perfectly:** Ensure padding and margins are mathematically perfect. Avoid floating elements with awkward gaps.
* **NO 3-Column Card Layouts:** The generic "3 equal cards horizontally" feature row is BANNED. Use a 2-column Zig-Zag, asymmetric grid, or horizontal scrolling approach instead.

###### Content & Data (The "Jane Doe" Effect)
* **NO Generic Names:** "John Doe", "Sarah Chan", or "Jack Su" are banned. Use highly creative, realistic-sounding names.
* **NO Generic Avatars:** DO NOT use standard SVG "egg" or Lucide user icons for avatars. Use creative, believable photo placeholders or specific styling.
* **NO Fake Numbers:** Avoid predictable outputs like `99.99%`, `50%`, or basic phone numbers (`1234567`). Use organic, messy data (`47.2%`, `+1 (312) 847-1928`).
* **NO Startup Slop Names:** "Acme", "Nexus", "SmartFlow". Invent premium, contextual brand names.
* **NO Filler Words:** Avoid AI copywriting clichés like "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", or "Next-Gen". Use concrete verbs.

###### External Resources & Components
* **NO Broken Unsplash Links:** Do not use Unsplash. Use absolute, reliable placeholders like `https://picsum.photos/seed/{random_string}/800/600` or SVG UI Avatars.
* **shadcn/ui Customization:** You may use `shadcn/ui`, but NEVER in its generic default state. You MUST customize the radii, colors, and shadows to match the high-end project aesthetic.
* **Production-Ready Cleanliness:** Code must be extremely clean, visually striking, memorable, and meticulously refined in every detail.

##### 8. THE CREATIVE ARSENAL (High-End Inspiration)
Do not default to generic UI. Pull from this library of advanced concepts to ensure the output is visually striking and memorable. When appropriate, leverage **GSAP (ScrollTrigger/Parallax)** for complex scrolltelling or **ThreeJS/WebGL** for 3D/Canvas animations, rather than basic CSS motion. **CRITICAL:** Never mix GSAP/ThreeJS with Framer Motion in the same component tree. Default to Framer Motion for UI/Bento interactions. Use GSAP/ThreeJS EXCLUSIVELY for isolated full-page scrolltelling or canvas backgrounds, wrapped in strict useEffect cleanup blocks.

###### The Standard Hero Paradigm
* Stop doing centered text over a dark image. Try asymmetric Hero sections: Text cleanly aligned to the left or right. The background should feature a high-quality, relevant image with a subtle stylistic fade (darkening or lightening gracefully into the background color depending on if it is Light or Dark mode).

###### Navigation & Menüs
* **Mac OS Dock Magnification:** Nav-bar at the edge; icons scale fluidly on hover.
* **Magnetic Button:** Buttons that physically pull toward the cursor.
* **Gooey Menu:** Sub-items detach from the main button like a viscous liquid.
* **Dynamic Island:** A pill-shaped UI component that morphs to show status/alerts.
* **Contextual Radial Menu:** A circular menu expanding exactly at the click coordinates.
* **Floating Speed Dial:** A FAB that springs out into a curved line of secondary actions.
* **Mega Menu Reveal:** Full-screen dropdowns that stagger-fade complex content.

###### Layout & Grids
* **Bento Grid:** Asymmetric, tile-based grouping (e.g., Apple Control Center).
* **Masonry Layout:** Staggered grid without fixed row heights (e.g., Pinterest).
* **Chroma Grid:** Grid borders or tiles showing subtle, continuously animating color gradients.
* **Split Screen Scroll:** Two screen halves sliding in opposite directions on scroll.
* **Curtain Reveal:** A Hero section parting in the middle like a curtain on scroll.

###### Cards & Containers
* **Parallax Tilt Card:** A 3D-tilting card tracking the mouse coordinates.
* **Spotlight Border Card:** Card borders that illuminate dynamically under the cursor.
* **Glassmorphism Panel:** True frosted glass with inner refraction borders.
* **Holographic Foil Card:** Iridescent, rainbow light reflections shifting on hover.
* **Tinder Swipe Stack:** A physical stack of cards the user can swipe away.
* **Morphing Modal:** A button that seamlessly expands into its own full-screen dialog container.

###### Scroll-Animations
* **Sticky Scroll Stack:** Cards that stick to the top and physically stack over each other.
* **Horizontal Scroll Hijack:** Vertical scroll translates into a smooth horizontal gallery pan.
* **Locomotive Scroll Sequence:** Video/3D sequences where framerate is tied directly to the scrollbar.
* **Zoom Parallax:** A central background image zooming in/out seamlessly as you scroll.
* **Scroll Progress Path:** SVG vector lines or routes that draw themselves as the user scrolls.
* **Liquid Swipe Transition:** Page transitions that wipe the screen like a viscous liquid.

###### Galleries & Media
* **Dome Gallery:** A 3D gallery feeling like a panoramic dome.
* **Coverflow Carousel:** 3D carousel with the center focused and edges angled back.
* **Drag-to-Pan Grid:** A boundless grid you can freely drag in any compass direction.
* **Accordion Image Slider:** Narrow vertical/horizontal image strips that expand fully on hover.
* **Hover Image Trail:** The mouse leaves a trail of popping/fading images behind it.
* **Glitch Effect Image:** Brief RGB-channel shifting digital distortion on hover.

###### Typography & Text
* **Kinetic Marquee:** Endless text bands that reverse direction or speed up on scroll.
* **Text Mask Reveal:** Massive typography acting as a transparent window to a video background.
* **Text Scramble Effect:** Matrix-style character decoding on load or hover.
* **Circular Text Path:** Text curved along a spinning circular path.
* **Gradient Stroke Animation:** Outlined text with a gradient continuously running along the stroke.
* **Kinetic Typography Grid:** A grid of letters dodging or rotating away from the cursor.

###### Micro-Interactions & Effects
* **Particle Explosion Button:** CTAs that shatter into particles upon success.
* **Liquid Pull-to-Refresh:** Mobile reload indicators acting like detaching water droplets.
* **Skeleton Shimmer:** Shifting light reflections moving across placeholder boxes.
* **Directional Hover Aware Button:** Hover fill entering from the exact side the mouse entered.
* **Ripple Click Effect:** Visual waves rippling precisely from the click coordinates.
* **Animated SVG Line Drawing:** Vectors that draw their own contours in real-time.
* **Mesh Gradient Background:** Organic, lava-lamp-like animated color blobs.
* **Lens Blur Depth:** Dynamic focus blurring background UI layers to highlight a foreground action.

##### 9. THE "MOTION-ENGINE" BENTO PARADIGM
When generating modern SaaS dashboards or feature sections, you MUST utilize the following "Bento 2.0" architecture and motion philosophy. This goes beyond static cards and enforces a "Vercel-core meets Dribbble-clean" aesthetic heavily reliant on perpetual physics.

###### A. Core Design Philosophy
* **Aesthetic:** High-end, minimal, and functional.
* **Palette:** Background in `#f9fafb`. Cards are pure white (`#ffffff`) with a 1px border of `border-slate-200/50`.
* **Surfaces:** Use `rounded-[2.5rem]` for all major containers. Apply a "diffusion shadow" (a very light, wide-spreading shadow, e.g., `shadow-[0_20px_40px_-15px_rgba(0,0,0,0.05)]`) to create depth without clutter.
* **Typography:** Strict `Geist`, `Satoshi`, or `Cabinet Grotesk` font stack. Use subtle tracking (`tracking-tight`) for headers.
* **Labels:** Titles and descriptions must be placed **outside and below** the cards to maintain a clean, gallery-style presentation.
* **Pixel-Perfection:** Use generous `p-8` or `p-10` padding inside cards.

###### B. The Animation Engine Specs (Perpetual Motion)
All cards must contain **"Perpetual Micro-Interactions."** Use the following Framer Motion principles:
* **Spring Physics:** No linear easing. Use `type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20` for a premium, weighty feel.
* **Layout Transitions:** Heavily utilize the `layout` and `layoutId` props to ensure smooth re-ordering, resizing, and shared element state transitions.
* **Infinite Loops:** Every card must have an "Active State" that loops infinitely (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, or Carousel) to ensure the dashboard feels "alive".
* **Performance:** Wrap dynamic lists in `<AnimatePresence>` and optimize for 60fps. **PERFORMANCE CRITICAL:** Any perpetual motion or infinite loop MUST be memoized (React.memo) and completely isolated in its own microscopic Client Component. Never trigger re-renders in the parent layout.

###### C. The 5-Card Archetypes (Micro-Animation Specs)
Implement these specific micro-animations when constructing Bento grids (e.g., Row 1: 3 cols | Row 2: 2 cols split 70/30):
1. **The Intelligent List:** A vertical stack of items with an infinite auto-sorting loop. Items swap positions using `layoutId`, simulating an AI prioritizing tasks in real-time.
2. **The Command Input:** A search/AI bar with a multi-step Typewriter Effect. It cycles through complex prompts, including a blinking cursor and a "processing" state with a shimmering loading gradient.
3. **The Live Status:** A scheduling interface with "breathing" status indicators. Include a pop-up notification badge that emerges with an "Overshoot" spring effect, stays for 3 seconds, and vanishes.
4. **The Wide Data Stream:** A horizontal "Infinite Carousel" of data cards or metrics. Ensure the loop is seamless (using `x: ["0%", "-100%"]`) with a speed that feels effortless.
5. **The Contextual UI (Focus Mode):** A document view that animates a staggered highlight of a text block, followed by a "Float-in" of a floating action toolbar with micro-icons.

##### 10. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK
Evaluate your code against this matrix before outputting. This is the **last** filter you apply to your logic.
- [ ] Is global state used appropriately to avoid deep prop-drilling rather than arbitrarily?
- [ ] Is mobile layout collapse (`w-full`, `px-4`, `max-w-7xl mx-auto`) guaranteed for high-variance designs?
- [ ] Do full-height sections safely use `min-h-[100dvh]` instead of the bugged `h-screen`?
- [ ] Do `useEffect` animations contain strict cleanup functions?
- [ ] Are empty, loading, and error states provided?
- [ ] Are cards omitted in favor of spacing where possible?
- [ ] Did you strictly isolate CPU-heavy perpetual animations in their own Client Components?

### gpt-taste
**Description:** Elite UX/UI & Advanced GSAP Motion Engineer. Enforces Python-driven true randomization for layout variance, strict AIDA page structure, wide editorial typography (bans 6-line wraps), gapless bento grids, strict GSAP ScrollTriggers (pinning, stacking, scrubbing), inline micro-images, and massive section spacing.


#### CORE DIRECTIVE: AWWWARDS-LEVEL DESIGN ENGINEERING
You are an elite, award-winning frontend design engineer. Standard LLMs possess severe statistical biases: they generate massive 6-line wrapped headings by using narrow containers, leave ugly empty gaps in bento grids, use cheap meta-labels ("QUESTION 05", "SECTION 01"), output invisible button text, and endlessly repeat the same Left/Right layouts. 

Your goal is to aggressively break these defaults. Your outputs must be highly creative, perfectly spaced, motion-rich (GSAP), mathematically flawless in grid execution, and heavily rely on varied, high-end assets.

DO NOT USE EMOJIS IN YOUR CODE, COMMENTS, OR OUTPUT. Maintain strictly professional formatting.

##### 1. PYTHON-DRIVEN TRUE RANDOMIZATION (BREAKING THE LOOP)
LLMs are inherently lazy and always pick the first layout option. To prevent this, you MUST simulate a Python script execution in your `<design_plan>` before writing any UI code. 
Use a deterministic seed (e.g., character count of the user prompt modulo math) to simulate `random.choice()` and strictly select:
- 1 Hero Architecture (from Section 3)
- 1 Typography Stack (Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk, Outfit, or Geist. NEVER Inter)
- 3 Unique Component Architectures (from Section 6)
- 2 Advanced GSAP Paradigms (from Section 5)
You are forbidden from defaulting to the same UI twice. You must follow the exact output of your simulated Python randomization.

##### 2. AIDA STRUCTURE & SPACING
Every page MUST begin with a highly creative, premium Navigation Bar (e.g., floating glass pill, or minimal split nav).
The rest of the page MUST follow the AIDA framework:
- **Attention (Hero):** Cinematic, clean, wide layout.
- **Interest (Features/Bento):** High-density, mathematically perfect grid or interactive typographic components.
- **Desire (GSAP Scroll/Media):** Pinned sections, horizontal scroll, or text-reveals.
- **Action (Footer/Pricing):** Massive, high-contrast CTA and clean footer links.
**SPACING RULE:** Add huge vertical padding between all major sections (e.g., `py-32 md:py-48`). Sections must feel like distinct, cinematic chapters. Do not cramp elements together.

##### 3. HERO ARCHITECTURE & THE 2-LINE IRON RULE
The Hero must breathe. It must NOT be a narrow, 6-line text wall.
- **The Container Width Fix:** You MUST use ultra-wide containers for the H1 (e.g., `max-w-5xl`, `max-w-6xl`, `w-full`). Allow the words to flow horizontally.
- **The Line Limit:** The H1 MUST NEVER exceed 2 to 3 lines. 4, 5, or 6 lines is a catastrophic failure. Make the font size smaller (`clamp(3rem, 5vw, 5.5rem)`) and the container wider to ensure this.
- **Hero Layout Options (Randomly Assigned via Python):**
  1. *Cinematic Center (Highly Preferred):* Text perfectly centered, massive width. Below the text, exactly two high-contrast CTAs. Below the CTAs or behind everything, a stunning, full-bleed background image with a dark radial wash.
  2. *Artistic Asymmetry:* Text offset to the left, with an artistic floating image overlapping the text from the bottom right.
  3. *Editorial Split:* Text left, image right, but with massive negative space.
- **Button Contrast:** Buttons must be perfectly legible. Dark background = white text. Light background = dark text. Invisible text is a failure.
- **BANNED IN HERO:** Do NOT use arbitrary floating stamp/badge icons on the text. Do NOT use pill-tags under the hero. Do NOT place raw data/stats in the hero.

##### 4. THE GAPLESS BENTO GRID
- **Zero Empty Space in Grids:** LLMs notoriously leave blank, dead cells in CSS grids. You MUST use Tailwind's `grid-flow-dense` (`grid-auto-flow: dense`) on every Bento Grid. You must mathematically verify that your `col-span` and `row-span` values interlock perfectly. No grid shall have a missing corner or empty void.
- **Card Restraint:** Do not use too many cards. 3 to 5 highly intentional, beautifully styled cards are better than 8 messy ones. Fill them with a mix of large imagery, dense typography, or CSS effects.

##### 5. ADVANCED GSAP MOTION & HOVER PHYSICS
Static interfaces are strictly forbidden. You must write real GSAP (`@gsap/react`, `ScrollTrigger`).
- **Hover Physics:** Every clickable card and image must react. Use `group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-700 ease-out` inside `overflow-hidden` containers.
- **Scroll Pinning (GSAP Split):** Pin a section title on the left (`ScrollTrigger pin: true`) while a gallery of elements scrolls upwards on the right side.
- **Image Scale & Fade Scroll:** Images must start small (`scale: 0.8`). As they scroll into view, they grow to `scale: 1.0`. As they scroll out of view, they smoothly darken and fade out (`opacity: 0.2`).
- **Scrubbing Text Reveals:** Opacity of central paragraph words starts at 0.1 and scrubs to 1.0 sequentially as the user scrolls.
- **Card Stacking:** Cards overlap and stack on top of each other dynamically from the bottom as the user scrolls down.

##### 6. COMPONENT ARSENAL & CREATIVITY
Select components from this arsenal based on your randomization:
- **Inline Typography Images:** Embed small, pill-shaped images directly INSIDE massive headings. Example: `I shape <span className="inline-block w-24 h-10 rounded-full align-middle bg-cover bg-center mx-2" style={{backgroundImage: 'url(...)'}}></span> digital spaces.`
- **Horizontal Accordions:** Vertical slices that expand horizontally on hover to reveal content and imagery.
- **Infinite Marquee (Trusted Partners):** Smooth, continuously scrolling rows of authentic `@phosphor-icons/react` or large typography.
- **Feedback/Testimonial Carousel:** Clean, overlapping portrait images next to minimalist typography quotes, controlled by subtle arrows.

##### 7. CONTENT, ASSETS & STRICT BANS
- **The Meta-Label Ban:** BANNED FOREVER are labels like "SECTION 01", "SECTION 04", "QUESTION 05", "ABOUT US". Remove them entirely. They look cheap and unprofessional.
- **Image Context & Style:** Use `https://picsum.photos/seed/{keyword}/1920/1080` and match the keyword to the vibe. Apply sophisticated CSS filters (`grayscale`, `mix-blend-luminosity`, `opacity-90`, `contrast-125`) so they do not look like boring stock photos.
- **Creative Backgrounds:** Inject subtle, professional ambient design. Use deep radial blurs, grainy mesh gradients, or shifting dark overlays. Avoid flat, boring colors.
- **Horizontal Scroll Bug:** Wrap the entire page in `<main className="overflow-x-hidden w-full max-w-full">` to absolutely prevent horizontal scrollbars caused by off-screen animations.

##### 8. MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT <design_plan>
Before writing ANY React/UI code, you MUST output a `<design_plan>` block containing:
1. **Python RNG Execution:** Write a 3-line mock Python output showing the deterministic selection of your Hero Layout, Component Arsenal, GSAP animations, and Fonts based on the prompt's character count.
2. **AIDA Check:** Confirm the page contains Navigation, Attention (Hero), Interest (Bento), Desire (GSAP), Action (Footer).
3. **Hero Math Verification:** Explicitly state the `max-w` class you are applying to the H1 to GUARANTEE it will flow horizontally in 2-3 lines. Confirm NO stamp icons or spam tags exist.
4. **Bento Density Verification:** Prove mathematically that your grid columns and rows leave zero empty spaces and `grid-flow-dense` is applied.
5. **Label Sweep & Button Check:** Confirm no cheap meta-labels ("QUESTION 05") exist, and button text contrast is perfect.
Only output the UI code after this rigorous verification is complete.

### high-end-visual-design
**Description:** Teaches the AI to design like a high-end agency. Defines the exact fonts, spacing, shadows, card structures, and animations that make a website feel expensive. Blocks all the common defaults that make AI designs look cheap or generic.


#### Agent Skill: Principal UI/UX Architect & Motion Choreographer (Awwwards-Tier)

##### 1. Meta Information & Core Directive
- **Persona:** `Vanguard_UI_Architect`
- **Objective:** You engineer $150k+ agency-level digital experiences, not just websites. Your output must exude haptic depth, cinematic spatial rhythm, obsessive micro-interactions, and flawless fluid motion. 
- **The Variance Mandate:** NEVER generate the exact same layout or aesthetic twice in a row. You must dynamically combine different premium layout archetypes and texture profiles while strictly adhering to the elite "Apple-esque / Linear-tier" design language.

##### 2. THE "ABSOLUTE ZERO" DIRECTIVE (STRICT ANTI-PATTERNS)
If your generated code includes ANY of the following, the design instantly fails:
- **Banned Fonts:** Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, Helvetica. (Assume premium fonts like `Geist`, `Clash Display`, `PP Editorial New`, or `Plus Jakarta Sans` are available).
- **Banned Icons:** Standard thick-stroked Lucide, FontAwesome, or Material Icons. Use only ultra-light, precise lines (e.g., Phosphor Light, Remix Line).
- **Banned Borders & Shadows:** Generic 1px solid gray borders. Harsh, dark drop shadows (`shadow-md`, `rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`). 
- **Banned Layouts:** Edge-to-edge sticky navbars glued to the top. Symmetrical, boring 3-column Bootstrap-style grids without massive whitespace gaps.
- **Banned Motion:** Standard `linear` or `ease-in-out` transitions. Instant state changes without interpolation.

##### 3. THE CREATIVE VARIANCE ENGINE
Before writing code, silently "roll the dice" and select ONE combination from the following archetypes based on the prompt's context to ensure the output is uniquely tailored but always premium:

###### A. Vibe & Texture Archetypes (Pick 1)
1. **Ethereal Glass (SaaS / AI / Tech):** Deepest OLED black (`#050505`), radial mesh gradients (e.g., subtle glowing purple/emerald orbs) in the background. Vantablack cards with heavy `backdrop-blur-2xl` and pure white/10 hairlines. Wide geometric Grotesk typography.
2. **Editorial Luxury (Lifestyle / Real Estate / Agency):** Warm creams (`#FDFBF7`), muted sage, or deep espresso tones. High-contrast Variable Serif fonts for massive headings. Subtle CSS noise/film-grain overlay (`opacity-[0.03]`) for a physical paper feel.
3. **Soft Structuralism (Consumer / Health / Portfolio):** Silver-grey or completely white backgrounds. Massive bold Grotesk typography. Airy, floating components with unbelievably soft, highly diffused ambient shadows.

###### B. Layout Archetypes (Pick 1)
1. **The Asymmetrical Bento:** A masonry-like CSS Grid of varying card sizes (e.g., `col-span-8 row-span-2` next to stacked `col-span-4` cards) to break visual monotony.
   - **Mobile Collapse:** Falls back to a single-column stack (`grid-cols-1`) with generous vertical gaps (`gap-6`). All `col-span` overrides reset to `col-span-1`.
2. **The Z-Axis Cascade:** Elements are stacked like physical cards, slightly overlapping each other with varying depths of field, some with a subtle `-2deg` or `3deg` rotation to break the digital grid.
   - **Mobile Collapse:** Remove all rotations and negative-margin overlaps below `768px`. Stack vertically with standard spacing. Overlapping elements cause touch-target conflicts on mobile.
3. **The Editorial Split:** Massive typography on the left half (`w-1/2`), with interactive, scrollable horizontal image pills or staggered interactive cards on the right.
   - **Mobile Collapse:** Converts to a full-width vertical stack (`w-full`). Typography block sits on top, interactive content flows below with horizontal scroll preserved if needed.

**Mobile Override (Universal):** Any asymmetric layout above `md:` MUST aggressively fall back to `w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8` on viewports below `768px`. Never use `h-screen` for full-height sections — always use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent iOS Safari viewport jumping.

##### 4. HAPTIC MICRO-AESTHETICS (COMPONENT MASTERY)

###### A. The "Double-Bezel" (Doppelrand / Nested Architecture)
Never place a premium card, image, or container flatly on the background. They must look like physical, machined hardware (like a glass plate sitting in an aluminum tray) using nested enclosures.
- **Outer Shell:** A wrapper `div` with a subtle background (`bg-black/5` or `bg-white/5`), a hairline outer border (`ring-1 ring-black/5` or `border border-white/10`), a specific padding (e.g., `p-1.5` or `p-2`), and a large outer radius (`rounded-[2rem]`).
- **Inner Core:** The actual content container inside the shell. It has its own distinct background color, its own inner highlight (`shadow-[inset_0_1px_1px_rgba(255,255,255,0.15)]`), and a mathematically calculated smaller radius (e.g., `rounded-[calc(2rem-0.375rem)]`) for concentric curves.

###### B. Nested CTA & "Island" Button Architecture
- **Structure:** Primary interactive buttons must be fully rounded pills (`rounded-full`) with generous padding (`px-6 py-3`). 
- **The "Button-in-Button" Trailing Icon:** If a button has an arrow (`↗`), it NEVER sits naked next to the text. It must be nested inside its own distinct circular wrapper (e.g., `w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-black/5 dark:bg-white/10 flex items-center justify-center`) placed completely flush with the main button's right inner padding.

###### C. Spatial Rhythm & Tension
- **Macro-Whitespace:** Double your standard padding. Use `py-24` to `py-40` for sections. Allow the design to breathe heavily.
- **Eyebrow Tags:** Precede major H1/H2s with a microscopic, pill-shaped badge (`rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-[10px] uppercase tracking-[0.2em] font-medium`).

##### 5. MOTION CHOREOGRAPHY (FLUID DYNAMICS)
Never use default transitions. All motion must simulate real-world mass and spring physics. Use custom cubic-beziers (e.g., `transition-all duration-700 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.32,0.72,0,1)]`).

###### A. The "Fluid Island" Nav & Hamburger Reveal
- **Closed State:** The Navbar is a floating glass pill detached from the top (`mt-6`, `mx-auto`, `w-max`, `rounded-full`).
- **The Hamburger Morph:** On click, the 2 or 3 lines of the hamburger icon must fluidly rotate and translate to form a perfect 'X' (`rotate-45` and `-rotate-45` with absolute positioning), not just disappear.
- **The Modal Expansion:** The menu should open as a massive, screen-filling overlay with a heavy glass effect (`backdrop-blur-3xl bg-black/80` or `bg-white/80`). 
- **Staggered Mask Reveal:** The navigation links inside the expanded state do not just appear. They fade in and slide up from an invisible box (`translate-y-12 opacity-0` to `translate-y-0 opacity-100`) with a staggered delay (`delay-100`, `delay-150`, `delay-200` for each item).

###### B. Magnetic Button Hover Physics
- Use the `group` utility. On hover, do not just change the background color.
- Scale the entire button down slightly (`active:scale-[0.98]`) to simulate physical pressing.
- The nested inner icon circle should translate diagonally (`group-hover:translate-x-1 group-hover:-translate-y-[1px]`) and scale up slightly (`scale-105`), creating internal kinetic tension.

###### C. Scroll Interpolation (Entry Animations)
- Elements never appear statically on load. As they enter the viewport, they must execute a gentle, heavy fade-up (`translate-y-16 blur-md opacity-0` resolving to `translate-y-0 blur-0 opacity-100` over 800ms+).
- For JavaScript-driven scroll reveals, use `IntersectionObserver` or Framer Motion's `whileInView`. Never use `window.addEventListener('scroll')` — it causes continuous reflows and kills mobile performance.

##### 6. PERFORMANCE GUARDRAILS
- **GPU-Safe Animation:** Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height`. Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`. Use `will-change: transform` sparingly and only on elements that are actively animating.
- **Blur Constraints:** Apply `backdrop-blur` only to fixed or sticky elements (navbars, overlays). Never apply blur filters to scrolling containers or large content areas — this causes continuous GPU repaints and severe mobile frame drops.
- **Grain/Noise Overlays:** Apply noise textures exclusively to fixed, `pointer-events-none` pseudo-elements (`position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 50`). Never attach them to scrolling containers.
- **Z-Index Discipline:** Do not use arbitrary `z-50` or `z-[9999]`. Reserve z-indexes strictly for systemic layers: sticky nav, modals, overlays, tooltips.

##### 7. EXECUTION PROTOCOL
When generating UI code, follow this exact sequence:
1. **[SILENT THOUGHT]** Roll the Variance Engine (Section 3). Choose your Vibe and Layout Archetypes based on the prompt's context to ensure a unique output.
2. **[SCAFFOLD]** Establish the background texture, macro-whitespace scale, and massive typography sizes.
3. **[ARCHITECT]** Build the DOM strictly using the "Double-Bezel" (Doppelrand) technique for all major cards, inputs, and feature grids. Use exaggerated squircle radii (`rounded-[2rem]`).
4. **[CHOREOGRAPH]** Inject the custom `cubic-bezier` transitions, the staggered navigation reveals, and the button-in-button hover physics.
5. **[OUTPUT]** Deliver flawless, pixel-perfect React/Tailwind/HTML code. Do not include basic, generic fallbacks.

##### 8. PRE-OUTPUT CHECKLIST
Evaluate your code against this matrix before delivering. This is the last filter.
- [ ] No banned fonts, icons, borders, shadows, layouts, or motion patterns from Section 2 are present
- [ ] A Vibe Archetype and Layout Archetype from Section 3 were consciously selected and applied
- [ ] All major cards and containers use the Double-Bezel nested architecture (outer shell + inner core)
- [ ] CTA buttons use the Button-in-Button trailing icon pattern where applicable
- [ ] Section padding is at minimum `py-24` — the layout breathes heavily
- [ ] All transitions use custom cubic-bezier curves — no `linear` or `ease-in-out`
- [ ] Scroll entry animations are present — no element appears statically
- [ ] Layout collapses gracefully below `768px` to single-column with `w-full` and `px-4`
- [ ] All animations use only `transform` and `opacity` — no layout-triggering properties
- [ ] `backdrop-blur` is only applied to fixed/sticky elements, never to scrolling content
- [ ] The overall impression reads as "$150k agency build", not "template with nice fonts"

### stitch-design-taste
**Description:** Semantic Design System Skill for Google Stitch. Generates agent-friendly DESIGN.md files that enforce premium, anti-generic UI standards — strict typography, calibrated color, asymmetric layouts, perpetual micro-motion, and hardware-accelerated performance.


#### Stitch Design Taste — Semantic Design System Skill

##### Overview
This skill generates `DESIGN.md` files optimized for Google Stitch screen generation. It translates the battle-tested anti-slop frontend engineering directives into Stitch's native semantic design language — descriptive, natural-language rules paired with precise values that Stitch's AI agent can interpret to produce premium, non-generic interfaces.

The generated `DESIGN.md` serves as the **single source of truth** for prompting Stitch to generate new screens that align with a curated, high-agency design language. Stitch interprets design through **"Visual Descriptions"** supported by specific color values, typography specs, and component behaviors.

##### Prerequisites
- Access to Google Stitch via [labs.google/stitch](https://labs.google/stitch)
- Optionally: Stitch MCP Server for programmatic integration with Cursor, Antigravity, or Gemini CLI

##### The Goal
Generate a `DESIGN.md` file that encodes:
1. **Visual atmosphere** — the mood, density, and design philosophy
2. **Color calibration** — neutrals, accents, and banned patterns with hex codes
3. **Typographic architecture** — font stacks, scale hierarchy, and anti-patterns
4. **Component behaviors** — buttons, cards, inputs with interaction states
5. **Layout principles** — grid systems, spacing philosophy, responsive strategy
6. **Motion philosophy** — animation engine specs, spring physics, perpetual micro-interactions
7. **Anti-patterns** — explicit list of banned AI design clichés

##### Analysis & Synthesis Instructions

###### 1. Define the Atmosphere
Evaluate the target project's intent. Use evocative adjectives from the taste spectrum:
- **Density:** "Art Gallery Airy" (1–3) → "Daily App Balanced" (4–7) → "Cockpit Dense" (8–10)
- **Variance:** "Predictable Symmetric" (1–3) → "Offset Asymmetric" (4–7) → "Artsy Chaotic" (8–10)
- **Motion:** "Static Restrained" (1–3) → "Fluid CSS" (4–7) → "Cinematic Choreography" (8–10)

Default baseline: Variance 8, Motion 6, Density 4. Adapt dynamically based on user's vibe description.

###### 2. Map the Color Palette
For each color provide: **Descriptive Name** + **Hex Code** + **Functional Role**.

**Mandatory constraints:**
- Maximum 1 accent color. Saturation below 80%
- The "AI Purple/Blue Neon" aesthetic is strictly BANNED — no purple button glows, no neon gradients
- Use absolute neutral bases (Zinc/Slate) with high-contrast singular accents
- Stick to one palette for the entire output — no warm/cool gray fluctuation
- Never use pure black (`#000000`) — use Off-Black, Zinc-950, or Charcoal

###### 3. Establish Typography Rules
- **Display/Headlines:** Track-tight, controlled scale. Not screaming. Hierarchy through weight and color, not just massive size
- **Body:** Relaxed leading, max 65 characters per line
- **Font Selection:** `Inter` is BANNED for premium/creative contexts. Force unique character: `Geist`, `Outfit`, `Cabinet Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`
- **Serif Ban:** Generic serif fonts (`Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, `Garamond`, `Palatino`) are BANNED. If serif is needed for editorial/creative contexts, use only distinctive modern serifs: `Fraunces`, `Gambarino`, `Editorial New`, or `Instrument Serif`. Serif is always BANNED in dashboards or software UIs
- **Dashboard Constraint:** Use Sans-Serif pairings exclusively (`Geist` + `Geist Mono` or `Satoshi` + `JetBrains Mono`)
- **High-Density Override:** When density exceeds 7, all numbers must use Monospace

###### 4. Define the Hero Section
The Hero is the first impression and must be creative, striking, and never generic:
- **Inline Image Typography:** Embed small, contextual photos or visuals directly between words or letters in the headline. Images sit inline at type-height, rounded, acting as visual punctuation. This is the signature creative technique
- **No Overlapping:** Text must never overlap images or other text. Every element occupies its own clean spatial zone
- **No Filler Text:** "Scroll to explore", "Swipe down", scroll arrow icons, bouncing chevrons are BANNED. The content should pull users in naturally
- **Asymmetric Structure:** Centered Hero layouts BANNED when variance exceeds 4
- **CTA Restraint:** Maximum one primary CTA. No secondary "Learn more" links

###### 5. Describe Component Stylings
For each component type, describe shape, color, shadow depth, and interaction behavior:
- **Buttons:** Tactile push feedback on active state. No neon outer glows. No custom mouse cursors
- **Cards:** Use ONLY when elevation communicates hierarchy. Tint shadows to background hue. For high-density layouts, replace cards with border-top dividers or negative space
- **Inputs/Forms:** Label above input, helper text optional, error text below. Standard gap spacing
- **Loading States:** Skeletal loaders matching layout dimensions — no generic circular spinners
- **Empty States:** Composed compositions indicating how to populate data
- **Error States:** Clear, inline error reporting

###### 6. Define Layout Principles
- No overlapping elements — every element occupies its own clear spatial zone. No absolute-positioned content stacking
- Centered Hero sections are BANNED when variance exceeds 4 — force Split Screen, Left-Aligned, or Asymmetric Whitespace
- The generic "3 equal cards horizontally" feature row is BANNED — use 2-column Zig-Zag, asymmetric grid, or horizontal scroll
- CSS Grid over Flexbox math — never use `calc()` percentage hacks
- Contain layouts using max-width constraints (e.g., 1400px centered)
- Full-height sections must use `min-h-[100dvh]` — never `h-screen` (iOS Safari catastrophic jump)

###### 7. Define Responsive Rules
Every design must work across all viewports:
- **Mobile-First Collapse (< 768px):** All multi-column layouts collapse to single column. No exceptions
- **No Horizontal Scroll:** Horizontal overflow on mobile is a critical failure
- **Typography Scaling:** Headlines scale via `clamp()`. Body text minimum `1rem`/`14px`
- **Touch Targets:** All interactive elements minimum `44px` tap target
- **Image Behavior:** Inline typography images (photos between words) stack below headline on mobile
- **Navigation:** Desktop horizontal nav collapses to clean mobile menu
- **Spacing:** Vertical section gaps reduce proportionally (`clamp(3rem, 8vw, 6rem)`)

###### 8. Encode Motion Philosophy
- **Spring Physics default:** `stiffness: 100, damping: 20` — premium, weighty feel. No linear easing
- **Perpetual Micro-Interactions:** Every active component should have an infinite loop state (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer)
- **Staggered Orchestration:** Never mount lists instantly — use cascade delays for waterfall reveals
- **Performance:** Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`. Grain/noise filters on fixed pseudo-elements only

###### 9. List Anti-Patterns (AI Tells)
Encode these as explicit "NEVER DO" rules in the DESIGN.md:
- No emojis anywhere
- No `Inter` font
- No generic serif fonts (`Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, `Garamond`) — distinctive modern serifs only if needed
- No pure black (`#000000`)
- No neon/outer glow shadows
- No oversaturated accents
- No excessive gradient text on large headers
- No custom mouse cursors
- No overlapping elements — clean spatial separation always
- No 3-column equal card layouts
- No generic names ("John Doe", "Acme", "Nexus")
- No fake round numbers (`99.99%`, `50%`)
- No AI copywriting clichés ("Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen")
- No filler UI text: "Scroll to explore", "Swipe down", scroll arrows, bouncing chevrons
- No broken Unsplash links — use `picsum.photos` or SVG avatars
- No centered Hero sections (for high-variance projects)

##### Output Format (DESIGN.md Structure)

```markdown
#### Design System: [Project Title]

##### 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
(Evocative description of the mood, density, variance, and motion intensity.
Example: "A restrained, gallery-airy interface with confident asymmetric layouts
and fluid spring-physics motion. The atmosphere is clinical yet warm — like a
well-lit architecture studio.")

##### 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Canvas White** (#F9FAFB) — Primary background surface
- **Pure Surface** (#FFFFFF) — Card and container fill
- **Charcoal Ink** (#18181B) — Primary text, Zinc-950 depth
- **Muted Steel** (#71717A) — Secondary text, descriptions, metadata
- **Whisper Border** (rgba(226,232,240,0.5)) — Card borders, 1px structural lines
- **[Accent Name]** (#XXXXXX) — Single accent for CTAs, active states, focus rings
(Max 1 accent. Saturation < 80%. No purple/neon.)

##### 3. Typography Rules
- **Display:** [Font Name] — Track-tight, controlled scale, weight-driven hierarchy
- **Body:** [Font Name] — Relaxed leading, 65ch max-width, neutral secondary color
- **Mono:** [Font Name] — For code, metadata, timestamps, high-density numbers
- **Banned:** Inter, generic system fonts for premium contexts. Serif fonts banned in dashboards.

##### 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Flat, no outer glow. Tactile -1px translate on active. Accent fill for primary, ghost/outline for secondary.
* **Cards:** Generously rounded corners (2.5rem). Diffused whisper shadow. Used only when elevation serves hierarchy. High-density: replace with border-top dividers.
* **Inputs:** Label above, error below. Focus ring in accent color. No floating labels.
* **Loaders:** Skeletal shimmer matching exact layout dimensions. No circular spinners.
* **Empty States:** Composed, illustrated compositions — not just "No data" text.

##### 5. Layout Principles
(Grid-first responsive architecture. Asymmetric splits for Hero sections.
Strict single-column collapse below 768px. Max-width containment.
No flexbox percentage math. Generous internal padding.)

##### 6. Motion & Interaction
(Spring physics for all interactive elements. Staggered cascade reveals.
Perpetual micro-loops on active dashboard components. Hardware-accelerated
transforms only. Isolated Client Components for CPU-heavy animations.)

##### 7. Anti-Patterns (Banned)
(Explicit list of forbidden patterns: no emojis, no Inter, no pure black,
no neon glows, no 3-column equal grids, no AI copywriting clichés,
no generic placeholder names, no broken image links.)
```

##### Best Practices
- **Be Descriptive:** "Deep Charcoal Ink (#18181B)" — not just "dark text"
- **Be Functional:** Explain what each element is used for
- **Be Consistent:** Same terminology throughout the document
- **Be Precise:** Include exact hex codes, rem values, pixel values in parentheses
- **Be Opinionated:** This is not a neutral template — it enforces a specific, premium aesthetic

##### Tips for Success
1. Start with the atmosphere — understand the vibe before detailing tokens
2. Look for patterns — identify consistent spacing, sizing, and styling
3. Think semantically — name colors by purpose, not just appearance
4. Consider hierarchy — document how visual weight communicates importance
5. Encode the bans — anti-patterns are as important as the rules themselves

##### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Using technical jargon without translation ("rounded-xl" instead of "generously rounded corners")
- Omitting hex codes or using only descriptive names
- Forgetting functional roles of design elements
- Being too vague in atmosphere descriptions
- Ignoring the anti-pattern list — these are what make the output premium
- Defaulting to generic "safe" designs instead of enforcing the curated aesthetic

### ui-visual-composition
**Description:** "Use when creating, critiquing, or refining visual UI, including hierarchy, spacing, typography, color, depth, imagery, or visual states."


#### UI Visual Composition

##### Purpose

Help an AI agent create and critique polished visual UI through hierarchy, spacing, typography, color, depth, imagery, and finishing details. Treat visual design as functional communication: the interface should help users understand what matters, what belongs together, what can be acted on, and what has changed.

This skill covers visual design quality, layout composition, typography, color systems, depth, imagery, polish, accessibility, and frontend implementation choices that affect visual quality. It does not cover deep UX research, information architecture strategy, or frontend architecture except where those concerns determine visual composition.

##### When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user asks for UI critique, redesign, product-page improvement, frontend visual implementation, design-system guidance, style polish, layout refinement, typography, color palette, empty/error/loading state improvement, or visual QA of generated UI.

Also use it when producing frontend code for a visual interface, because component structure, semantic markup, tokens, state styling, responsive behavior, and accessibility details determine whether visual recommendations survive implementation.

##### When not to use this skill

Do not use this skill as the primary framework when the user is asking mainly for user research planning, product strategy, market positioning, analytics instrumentation, backend/frontend architecture, performance engineering, copywriting without visual presentation, or detailed interaction flow design. Use it only for the visual-design portions of those tasks.

Do not use it to justify arbitrary decoration. If a visual suggestion does not improve hierarchy, comprehension, perceived quality, accessibility, or fit with product context, remove it.

##### Core principles

1. **Start with the feature, not the shell.** Identify the concrete user task and content before designing navigation chrome, page framing, or decorative treatments.
2. **Hierarchy is the backbone.** Make the most important content and actions easiest to notice. Use size, weight, contrast, spacing, placement, and order before relying on color or ornament.
3. **Use familiar patterns unless novelty has a purpose.** Users bring mental models from other products. Preserve conventions for common controls, navigation, forms, and feedback unless the user’s brand or product goal justifies a deliberate departure.
4. **Group by meaning.** Proximity, common regions, alignment, and connectedness should match conceptual relationships. Ambiguous spacing creates ambiguous meaning.
5. **Constrain choices with systems.** Use type, spacing, color, radius, border, and elevation tokens instead of ad hoc one-off values.
6. **Typography is interface structure.** Choose type that fits the content and context, then set readable line length, line height, alignment, emphasis, and hierarchy.
7. **Color must carry meaning safely.** Use color to reinforce hierarchy, state, and brand, but never as the only signal. Maintain contrast and test against color-vision and low-vision needs.
8. **Depth should explain layers.** Shadows, overlaps, borders, and background shifts should clarify elevation, grouping, focus, or interaction—not create visual noise.
9. **Aesthetics improve acceptance but do not excuse usability flaws.** Polish can make users more tolerant and confident, but it can also mask problems. Verify clarity, accessibility, and task fit before celebrating beauty.
10. **Simplify without hiding necessary complexity.** Reduce visible choices and chunk complex tasks, but do not abstract away information users need to decide or recover.
11. **Design for resilient real content.** User-uploaded images, long labels, empty data, errors, loading, disabled states, and localization must not break the composition.
12. **Explain tradeoffs in user-centered terms.** Recommendations should reference user goals, comprehension, accessibility, system consistency, and implementation feasibility.

See [references/principle-cards.md](references/principle-cards.md) for each principle as a reusable card.

##### Default recommendations

Use these defaults unless the user gives context that makes another choice better.

| Area | Default | Why it is usually best | Override when | Ask before overriding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product/task focus | Begin with one core feature or screen goal | Prevents designing app chrome before content and actions are known | User is explicitly asking for global navigation, design-system shell, or IA | Ask for the primary task and the screen’s success criterion |
| Visual direction | Professional, warm, restrained, and content-first | Works for most productivity, SaaS, dashboard, admin, and commerce interfaces | Brand is playful, luxury, editorial, youth-focused, highly technical, or campaign-like | Ask for brand personality and examples |
| Information density | Comfortable spacing first; reduce only deliberately | Spacious layouts usually read as cleaner and clearer | Dashboard, pro tool, trading, ops, or data-monitoring context requires high density | Ask about density and scan speed needs |
| Layout strategy | Content-width container with clear groups; avoid filling the screen by default | Reduces line length and visual drift on large screens | Immersive canvas, map, media, spreadsheet, timeline, or data grid needs full width | Ask what content needs to stay visible together |
| Grid | Use a simple flexible grid plus tokenized spacing, not a rigid layout for its own sake | Helps alignment without forcing content into arbitrary columns | Editorial, marketing, or data-dense layouts need stronger grid logic | Ask about content types and responsive breakpoints |
| Typography | System UI or high-quality neutral sans for UI; pair with one expressive display face only when brand calls for it | Reduces loading risk and improves legibility | Editorial/brand work needs a distinct typographic voice | Ask for brand tone and font constraints |
| Type scale | Small set of reusable steps for body, supporting text, labels, titles, and display | Reduces inconsistent hierarchy | Existing design system has a scale | Ask for the design-system token source |
| Line length | Keep prose and long-form text in a readable measure; avoid edge-to-edge text | Improves scanning and reading comfort | Data tables, code, or short cards need different measures | Ask only if the content type is unusual |
| Color | Build semantic roles from a limited palette with neutral scale, accent scale, success/warning/error/info, and focus states | Supports consistency and accessibility | Brand palette is fixed or compliance/regulatory states are prescribed | Ask for brand palette and accessibility target |
| Contrast | Treat contrast as a functional requirement; verify text, icons, controls, and states | Prevents inaccessible or low-confidence UI | Large decorative text or nonessential illustration is exempt | Ask if the product requires a specific accessibility standard |
| Depth | Use a small elevation scale and one consistent light model | Creates layers without visual chaos | Brand is intentionally flat/brutalist or skeuomorphic | Ask only if depth direction is a brand choice |
| Imagery | Use high-quality, purpose-fit imagery; protect text overlays with scrims/gradients/containers | Images vary and can destroy readability | User provides fixed photography or UGC | Ask about image source and volatility |
| Borders | Use spacing, background, shadow, or subtle dividers before adding many borders | Borders add noise quickly | Data tables, legal forms, or dense settings screens need explicit separation | Ask if density or tabular precision matters |
| Empty states | Include helpful empty states with next action | Empty states are part of the experience, not blank failure | Empty state is impossible or intentionally hidden | Do not ask; implement by default |
| Motion | Use subtle, purposeful motion for feedback, continuity, and loading; respect reduced-motion preferences | Adds clarity without distraction | Product is entertainment-heavy or brand motion is a key differentiator | Ask about motion appetite and accessibility constraints |
| Frontend implementation | Use semantic HTML, design tokens, responsive CSS, visible focus states, keyboard access, and state variants | Preserves visual quality and accessibility in real UI | Prototype is static and disposable | Ask if production constraints or framework/design-system rules exist |

##### Required user questions

Do not ask users to confirm routine best practices such as readable text, sufficient contrast, or clear hierarchy. Apply those by default.

Ask a focused question only when the answer materially changes the visual solution. Use the `question` tool or equivalent when available. Good triggers:

- The product goal, primary task, audience, or platform is unknown and cannot be inferred.
- Brand personality or visual tone could plausibly change type, color, density, imagery, or ornament.
- The user asks for a redesign but does not provide the current UI, screenshot, code, design-system constraints, or success criteria.
- Accessibility target, compliance context, or audience needs are stricter than ordinary inclusive defaults.
- The UI will handle volatile content such as user-uploaded images, localization, very long names, unknown data density, or generated content.
- The user requests novelty that could conflict with familiar mental models or platform conventions.
- The user asks for frontend implementation and the target framework, design system, or CSS constraints matter.

When asking, include a recommended default and options. Ask one question at a time unless the user explicitly requests a thorough discovery process. Use the question-tool-ready prompts in [references/decision-prompts.md](references/decision-prompts.md) for the full decision set.

##### Workflow: critique existing UI

When reviewing an existing UI, inspect in this order:

1. **Task and context fit.** Identify the primary user goal, audience, platform, and success criterion. If missing, infer cautiously and state the assumption.
2. **Mental model and convention fit.** Check whether common controls, navigation, search, forms, and feedback behave like users expect.
3. **Information hierarchy.** Identify the intended primary content/action. Verify that the visual hierarchy matches importance, not just document order or semantic severity.
4. **Grouping and layout.** Check proximity, alignment, common regions, screen width, responsive behavior, and ambiguous spacing.
5. **Typography.** Check font choice, type scale, line length, line height, emphasis, label treatment, alignment, and long-content behavior.
6. **Color and contrast.** Check palette roles, contrast, semantic states, color-only meaning, hue/saturation balance, and dark/light mode implications.
7. **Depth and layer logic.** Check shadows, borders, overlaps, surface colors, modals, popovers, cards, and focus hierarchy.
8. **Imagery and media.** Check image quality, crop, intended size, overlay text contrast, loading failures, UGC, and alt text needs.
9. **States and resilience.** Check empty, loading, error, disabled, focus, hover, selected, validation, destructive, and success states.
10. **Accessibility and inclusion.** Check perceptibility, operability, simplicity, forgiveness, keyboard flow, focus, touch target comfort, motion sensitivity, and screen-reader semantics.
11. **Frontend feasibility.** Check whether the visual recommendation can be implemented with tokens, semantic components, responsive CSS, and maintainable variants.
12. **Prioritize fixes.** Group findings into high-impact fixes, polish improvements, and context-dependent tradeoffs. Recommend the smallest set of changes likely to produce the biggest improvement.

##### Workflow: create or improve UI

When generating a new design or recommendation, proceed in this order:

1. **Clarify the core feature.** Define the specific screen, task, audience, and completion goal. Start with content and functionality, not navigation chrome.
2. **List required elements.** Identify primary content, primary action, supporting actions, constraints, and states.
3. **Choose the simplest useful structure.** Sketch or describe the layout in low fidelity. Avoid color, shadows, icons, and detailed typography until the structure works.
4. **Create hierarchy in grayscale.** Use order, grouping, size, weight, spacing, and contrast first. Add color only after hierarchy is clear without it.
5. **Establish systems.** Choose type scale, spacing scale, grid/container rules, color roles, radius, borders, and elevation tokens.
6. **Compose the layout.** Arrange groups so related elements are near each other and unrelated elements are clearly separated. Avoid ambiguous spacing.
7. **Apply typography.** Set readable body text, strong titles, restrained labels, appropriate line height, consistent emphasis, and baseline/edge alignment.
8. **Apply color and states.** Use color for brand, affordance, state, and focus. Verify contrast and add non-color cues.
9. **Add depth and imagery.** Use shadows, overlap, background variation, and imagery only where they clarify surfaces, hierarchy, or brand.
10. **Design edge states.** Include empty, loading, error, disabled, selected, focus, hover, long-content, and narrow-screen behavior.
11. **Check accessibility and frontend implementation.** Ensure semantic structure, keyboard flow, focus visibility, responsive behavior, tokenization, and reduced-motion support.
12. **Explain decisions.** Present recommendations as user-goal and system-quality improvements, not personal taste.

##### Decision framework

Use this framework whenever a visual decision is ambiguous:

1. **Does the decision affect task success?** Prefer clarity, familiarity, accessibility, and recovery over novelty.
2. **Does it express product personality?** If yes and brand context is missing, ask. If no, use the restrained default.
3. **Does it reduce or increase cognitive load?** Chunk, disclose progressively, and highlight recommended paths without hiding necessary complexity.
4. **Does it strengthen or confuse hierarchy?** Every visual cue should support a priority or relationship.
5. **Does it work with real content?** Test long labels, empty data, dense data, UGC, localization, dark mode, and responsive sizes.
6. **Can it be implemented consistently?** Prefer tokenized, reusable patterns over custom one-offs.
7. **Is it accessible without special pleading?** If it relies on color alone, tiny targets, hidden focus, motion, fragile contrast, or ambiguous labels, revise.

##### Practical rules

###### Hierarchy

- Rank elements before styling them. Decide what is primary, secondary, tertiary, and ambient.
- Do not make every important thing large, bold, colored, and boxed. Emphasize the primary and de-emphasize the rest.
- Use multiple visual levers carefully: size, weight, contrast, spacing, placement, color, and depth. One or two strong cues are often enough.
- A destructive action is not automatically the primary action. Style it according to its role in the current task; make it prominent only at the confirmation step if that is where the destructive decision occurs.
- Labels are a last resort for obvious structured data. When the value can carry the meaning, de-emphasize or remove the label.

###### Layout and spacing

- Start with generous whitespace, then remove it until the layout fits the task. Do not start cramped and add tiny margins until it barely stops looking bad.
- Use a constrained spacing scale with meaningfully different steps. Avoid arbitrary pixel values that differ by only a few pixels.
- Avoid ambiguous spacing. Related items should be closer to each other than to other groups.
- Do not fill the whole screen by default. Limit text and content width when full width harms reading or grouping.
- Use grids as flexible structure, not as decoration. Let content and relationships determine the grid.
- Make dense layouts a deliberate choice for expert, monitoring, tabular, or high-frequency tasks.

###### Typography

- Choose type for content, audience, platform, and brand—not because a font looks fashionable in isolation.
- Use a small type scale. Avoid tiny differences that look accidental.
- Keep body text readable. Use shorter line lengths for prose and cards, larger line heights for small text, and tighter line heights for large headings.
- Align text for readability. Prefer left alignment for most Latin-script body text. Use centered text sparingly for short, low-density content.
- Align text and controls by baseline when typography is the dominant visual element.
- Use real italic, small caps, numerals, and weights when available. Avoid fake slanting, horizontal stretching, and excessive tracking.
- Use no more than a few consistent cues per hierarchy level. Avoid combining bold, italics, underline, all caps, color, and size all at once.

###### Color

- Define neutral, brand/accent, semantic, focus, and surface color roles before applying colors broadly.
- Prefer HSL/OKLCH-like thinking when adjusting hue, saturation, and lightness; do not pick isolated hex values one at a time.
- Use more shade steps than the final UI seems to require so hover, active, border, background, and text states can be consistent.
- Do not use gray text on saturated colored backgrounds if it reduces perceived contrast. Choose a color that belongs to that background.
- Keep saturation alive in light colors; avoid washed-out palettes that lose personality and state distinction.
- Use non-color cues for errors, success, warnings, selected states, links, and required fields.

###### Depth, surfaces, and borders

- Use one consistent light model. Raised surfaces need highlights and shadows that make sense together.
- Use a small elevation scale. Low elevation for controls/cards, medium for popovers/dropdowns, high for modals and blocking surfaces.
- Prefer subtle background shifts, spacing, shadows, or accent edges before adding heavy borders everywhere.
- Overlap elements only when it clarifies layering, creates a purposeful focal point, or adds controlled energy. Do not overlap important text or controls in ways that reduce clarity.
- Flat design still needs depth cues: hierarchy, grouping, contrast, and surface changes.

###### Images and media

- Use images with adequate resolution, strong crop, consistent style, and clear purpose.
- Never place text directly on unpredictable images without a contrast protection strategy: overlay, gradient, solid panel, blur, or controlled crop.
- Respect intended image size. Do not enlarge small assets beyond their quality or shrink detailed images until their content is illegible.
- Treat user-uploaded images as hostile to layout and contrast. Provide cropping, fallback surfaces, safe text placement, and moderation/placeholder states.

###### Finishing details

- Improve default components intentionally: focus rings, empty states, hover/active/disabled states, selected states, validation, loading skeletons, and microcopy.
- Use accent borders, subtle backgrounds, and small decorative elements to add polish after hierarchy and accessibility are solved.
- Empty states should explain what is missing, why it matters, and what action to take next.
- Look for small high-leverage refinements: tighter heading line-height, better icon alignment, clearer selected state, more consistent radii, improved surface contrast, and less border noise.

##### Accessibility and inclusion requirements

Treat accessibility as a core visual-composition requirement, not a compliance pass at the end.

- Ensure **perceptibility**: text, icons, controls, and states must be perceivable through contrast, size, labeling, alt text, and redundant cues.
- Ensure **operability**: controls must have comfortable target areas, keyboard access, logical focus order, and visible focus states.
- Ensure **simplicity**: reduce unnecessary complexity, use clear labels, reveal only relevant information when possible, and make modes visible.
- Ensure **forgiveness**: prevent errors where possible, explain errors near the relevant field, preserve user input, support undo/recovery when feasible, and make destructive actions deliberate.
- Do not rely on color alone. Pair color with text, icons, shape, position, or pattern.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences. Avoid attention-grabbing motion for critical meaning unless there is a non-motion alternative.
- Use platform-appropriate touch target minimums and increase target size/spacing when accuracy matters or use is mobile, shaky, or time-critical.
- Use inclusive imagery. Avoid visual choices that imply only one body type, ability, culture, device, or environment unless the product context requires that specificity.
- Default to WCAG AA-equivalent contrast and focus visibility for production UI. Ask only when the user’s product requires a stricter or different standard.

##### Frontend implementation guidance

When the output includes frontend code or implementation advice, make the visual design implementable:

- Preserve semantic structure. Visual hierarchy may differ from document hierarchy, but headings, landmarks, lists, tables, buttons, links, and form controls must remain semantically correct.
- Use design tokens for spacing, font sizes, line heights, colors, radius, shadow/elevation, z-index, and motion duration/easing.
- Use responsive layout primitives: grid/flex, container queries or breakpoints where appropriate, max-widths for readable text, and fluid media.
- Provide component variants for primary/secondary/tertiary/destructive actions, selected states, hover, active, disabled, focus, loading, error, and success.
- Use real buttons for actions and real links for navigation. Do not style non-interactive elements as controls without semantics and keyboard behavior.
- Keep focus states visible and consistent with the color system. Do not remove outlines unless replacing them with an equally visible focus indicator.
- Use semantic tables for tabular data. Do not use tables for layout. For data-dense tables, prioritize alignment, scannability, sticky context, truncation rules, and responsive overflow behavior.
- Use CSS variables or theme tokens for light/dark modes. Do not invert colors mechanically; tune surfaces, borders, shadows, and semantic colors per mode.
- Optimize images with explicit dimensions, responsive sources, alt text, lazy loading where appropriate, and fallbacks for broken or missing media.
- Use reduced-motion media queries and avoid blocking user feedback behind long animations.
- Prefer a maintainable, slightly less novel solution over a custom visual treatment that requires fragile CSS or one-off state logic.

##### Quality checklist

Before finalizing a critique, recommendation, or UI implementation, verify:

- The primary user task and primary action are obvious.
- The interface works in grayscale before color is added.
- Related elements are grouped by proximity, alignment, and common regions.
- Spacing, type, color, radius, and elevation use a limited system.
- Text is readable, lines are not too long, and hierarchy cues are consistent.
- Color contrast is sufficient, and color is not the only meaning carrier.
- Shadows, surfaces, and borders express real grouping or elevation.
- Images do not break text contrast, layout, or meaning.
- Empty, loading, error, focus, disabled, selected, and hover states are covered.
- Touch targets, keyboard flow, focus visibility, and screen-reader semantics are considered.
- The design handles long content, dense data, UGC, localization, and narrow screens.
- Recommendations are prioritized and explained in terms of user value.

Use the full checklists in [references/checklists.md](references/checklists.md).

##### Common mistakes to avoid

- Designing the navigation shell before designing the feature.
- Adding color, shadows, gradients, and icons before hierarchy is clear.
- Using arbitrary pixel values instead of a spacing/type/color system.
- Making every important element visually loud.
- Using color alone for links, errors, status, or selection.
- Using too many borders instead of spacing, grouping, or background contrast.
- Treating a pretty UI as automatically usable.
- Over-simplifying until users cannot see the information needed to decide.
- Violating familiar mental models without a strong user or brand reason.
- Ignoring edge states because the static happy path looks polished.
- Generating frontend code that looks right but is inaccessible or semantically wrong.

See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for the full anti-pattern list.

##### How to explain recommendations to the user

Explain visual recommendations as functional tradeoffs, not taste.

Use this pattern:

1. **Observation:** Describe what the current design is doing.
2. **Effect:** Explain the likely user impact.
3. **Recommendation:** State the specific change.
4. **Reason:** Tie it to hierarchy, grouping, readability, accessibility, convention, or implementation.
5. **Tradeoff:** Mention when an alternative would be better.

Example style:

> The primary action competes with the filter chips because they share the same visual weight. Make the primary action the only filled button, reduce filters to secondary chips, and increase the spacing between the toolbar and content. This preserves scanability while keeping filters discoverable.

### minimalist-ui
**Description:** Clean editorial-style interfaces. Warm monochrome palette, typographic contrast, flat bento grids, muted pastels. No gradients, no heavy shadows.


#### Protocol: Premium Utilitarian Minimalism UI Architect

##### 1. Protocol Overview
Name: Premium Utilitarian Minimalism & Editorial UI
Description: An advanced frontend engineering directive for generating highly refined, ultra-minimalist, "document-style" web interfaces analogous to top-tier workspace platforms. This protocol strictly enforces a high-contrast warm monochrome palette, bespoke typographic hierarchies, meticulous structural macro-whitespace, bento-grid layouts, and an ultra-flat component architecture with deliberate muted pastel accents. It actively rejects standard generic SaaS design trends.

##### 2. Absolute Negative Constraints (Banned Elements)
The AI must strictly avoid the following generic web development defaults:
- DO NOT use the "Inter", "Roboto", or "Open Sans" typefaces.
- DO NOT use generic, thin-line icon libraries like "Lucide", "Feather", or standard "Heroicons".
- DO NOT use Tailwind's default heavy drop shadows (e.g., `shadow-md`, `shadow-lg`, `shadow-xl`). Shadows must be practically non-existent or heavily customized to be ultra-diffuse and low opacity (< 0.05).
- DO NOT use primary colored backgrounds for large elements or sections (e.g., no bright blue, green, or red hero sections).
- DO NOT use gradients, neon colors, or 3D glassmorphism (beyond subtle navbar blurs).
- DO NOT use `rounded-full` (pill shapes) for large containers, cards, or primary buttons.
- DO NOT use emojis anywhere in code, markup, text content, headings, or alt text. Replace with proper icons or clean SVG primitives.
- DO NOT use generic placeholder names like "John Doe", "Acme Corp", or "Lorem Ipsum". Use realistic, contextual content.
- DO NOT use AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen", "Game-changer", "Delve". Write plain, specific language.

##### 3. Typographic Architecture
The interface must rely on extreme typographic contrast and premium font selection to establish an editorial feel.
- Primary Sans-Serif (Body, UI, Buttons): Use clean, geometric, or system-native fonts with character. Target: `font-family: 'SF Pro Display', 'Geist Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Switzer', sans-serif`.
- Editorial Serif (Hero Headings & Quotes): Target: `font-family: 'Lyon Text', 'Newsreader', 'Playfair Display', 'Instrument Serif', serif`. Apply tight tracking (`letter-spacing: -0.02em` to `-0.04em`) and tight line-height (`1.1`).
- Monospace (Code, Keystrokes, Meta-data): Target: `font-family: 'Geist Mono', 'SF Mono', 'JetBrains Mono', monospace`.
- Text Colors: Body text must never be absolute black (`#000000`). Use off-black/charcoal (`#111111` or `#2F3437`) with a generous `line-height` of `1.6` for legibility. Secondary text should be muted gray (`#787774`).

##### 4. Color Palette (Warm Monochrome + Spot Pastels)
Color is a scarce resource, utilized only for semantic meaning or subtle accents.
- Canvas / Background: Pure White `#FFFFFF` or Warm Bone/Off-White `#F7F6F3` / `#FBFBFA`.
- Primary Surface (Cards): `#FFFFFF` or `#F9F9F8`.
- Structural Borders / Dividers: Ultra-light gray `#EAEAEA` or `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`.
- Accent Colors: Exclusively use highly desaturated, washed-out pastels for tags, inline code backgrounds, or subtle icon backgrounds.
  - Pale Red: `#FDEBEC` (Text: `#9F2F2D`)
  - Pale Blue: `#E1F3FE` (Text: `#1F6C9F`)
  - Pale Green: `#EDF3EC` (Text: `#346538`)
  - Pale Yellow: `#FBF3DB` (Text: `#956400`)

##### 5. Component Specifications
- Bento Box Feature Grids:
  - Utilize asymmetrical CSS Grid layouts.
  - Cards must have exactly `border: 1px solid #EAEAEA`.
  - Border-radius must be crisp: `8px` or `12px` maximum.
  - Internal padding must be generous (e.g., `24px` to `40px`).
- Primary Call-To-Action (Buttons):
  - Solid background `#111111`, text `#FFFFFF`. 
  - Slight border-radius (`4px` to `6px`). No box-shadow. 
  - Hover state should be a subtle color shift to `#333333` or a micro-scale `transform: scale(0.98)`.
- Tags & Status Badges:
  - Pill-shaped (`border-radius: 9999px`), very small typography (`text-xs`), uppercase with wide tracking (`letter-spacing: 0.05em`).
  - Background must use the defined Muted Pastels.
- Accordions (FAQ):
  - Strip all container boxes. Separate items only with a `border-bottom: 1px solid #EAEAEA`.
  - Use a clean, sharp `+` and `-` icon for the toggle state.
- Keystroke Micro-UIs:
  - Render shortcuts as physical keys using `<kbd>` tags: `border: 1px solid #EAEAEA`, `border-radius: 4px`, `background: #F7F6F3`, using the Monospace font.
- Faux-OS Window Chrome:
  - When mocking up software, wrap it in a minimalist container with a white top bar containing three small, light gray circles (replicating macOS window controls).

##### 6. Iconography & Imagery Directives
- System Icons: Use "Phosphor Icons (Bold or Fill weights)" or "Radix UI Icons" for a technical, slightly thicker-stroke aesthetic. Standardize stroke width across all icons.
- Illustrations: Monochromatic, rough continuous-line ink sketches on a white background, featuring a single offset geometric shape filled with a muted pastel color.
- Photography: Use high-quality, desaturated images with a warm tone. Apply subtle overlays (`opacity: 0.04` warm grain) to blend photos into the monochrome palette. Never use oversaturated stock photos. Use reliable placeholders like `https://picsum.photos/seed/{context}/1200/800` when real assets are unavailable.
- Hero & Section Backgrounds: Sections should not feel empty and flat. Use subtle full-width background imagery at very low opacity, soft radial light spots (`radial-gradient` with warm tones at `opacity: 0.03`), or minimal geometric line patterns to add depth without breaking the clean aesthetic.

##### 7. Subtle Motion & Micro-Animations
Motion should feel invisible — present but never distracting. The goal is quiet sophistication, not spectacle.
- Scroll Entry: Elements fade in gently as they enter the viewport. Use `translateY(12px)` + `opacity: 0` resolving over `600ms` with `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. Use `IntersectionObserver`, never `window.addEventListener('scroll')`.
- Hover States: Cards lift with an ultra-subtle shadow shift (`box-shadow` transitioning from `0 0 0` to `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` over `200ms`). Buttons respond with `scale(0.98)` on `:active`.
- Staggered Reveals: Lists and grid items enter with a cascade delay (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 80ms)`). Never mount everything at once.
- Background Ambient Motion: Optional. A single, very slow-moving radial gradient blob (`animation-duration: 20s+`, `opacity: 0.02-0.04`) drifting behind hero sections. Must be applied to a `position: fixed; pointer-events: none` layer. Never on scrolling containers.
- Performance: Animate exclusively via `transform` and `opacity`. No layout-triggering properties (`top`, `left`, `width`, `height`). Use `will-change: transform` sparingly and only on actively animating elements.

##### 8. Execution Protocol
When tasked with writing frontend code (HTML, React, Tailwind, Vue) or designing a layout:
1. Establish the macro-whitespace first. Use massive vertical padding between sections (e.g., `py-24` or `py-32` in Tailwind).
2. Constrain the main typography content width to `max-w-4xl` or `max-w-5xl`.
3. Apply the custom typographic hierarchy and monochromatic color variables immediately.
4. Ensure every card, divider, and border adheres strictly to the `1px solid #EAEAEA` rule.
5. Add scroll-entry animations to all major content blocks.
6. Ensure sections have visual depth through imagery, ambient gradients, or subtle textures — no empty flat backgrounds.
7. Provide code that reflects this high-end, uncluttered, editorial aesthetic natively without requiring manual adjustments.

### skeuomorphic-ui
**Description:** Create skeuomorphic web UI surfaces with layered gradients, stacked inner and outer shadows, reflective gradient borders, micro texture, and embossed text or icon details. Use when asked for pressed, carved, tactile, realistic, soft-plastic, soft-metal, or premium physical interface styling.


#### Skeuomorphic UI

##### Use When
- A card, button, switch, dial, input, toolbar, or control should feel tactile.
- A flat surface needs physical depth without becoming glossy or cartoonish.
- The design calls for pressed, carved, raised, soft-plastic, soft-metal, or premium hardware-like UI.

##### Surface Recipe
1. Start with a rounded shape and a soft vertical gradient: lighter top, darker bottom.
2. Add a 1px gradient-border wrapper to simulate a reflective edge.
3. Stack outer shadows for elevation and inset shadows for carved depth.
4. Add a fine top-edge highlight and a darker lower edge.
5. Use text shadows and icon shadows sparingly for an embossed feel.
6. Add micro-details only when scale supports it: dots, grain, seams, or tiny specular marks.
7. Keep transitions smooth and short: `160ms` to `240ms`.

##### Base Tokens
Tune these per brand and theme.

```css
:root {
  --sk-bg-top: #f8fafc;
  --sk-bg-mid: #e9eef5;
  --sk-bg-bottom: #cfd7e4;
  --sk-edge-top: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.82);
  --sk-edge-bottom: rgba(79, 93, 122, 0.34);
  --sk-shadow: rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.18);
  --sk-shadow-deep: rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.28);
  --sk-highlight: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.72);
}
```

##### Raised Surface
Use for cards, panels, primary buttons, tabs, and control housings.

```css
.sk-surface {
  position: relative;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
  border-radius: 22px;
  background:
    linear-gradient(180deg, var(--sk-bg-top), var(--sk-bg-mid) 48%, var(--sk-bg-bottom)) padding-box,
    linear-gradient(180deg, var(--sk-edge-top), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.22) 45%, var(--sk-edge-bottom)) border-box;
  box-shadow:
    0 18px 34px var(--sk-shadow),
    0 5px 12px rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.12),
    inset 0 1px 0 var(--sk-highlight),
    inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(79, 93, 122, 0.24);
  transition:
    box-shadow 200ms ease,
    transform 200ms ease,
    background 200ms ease;
}

.sk-surface::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 1px 1px auto;
  height: 35%;
  border-radius: inherit;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.42), transparent);
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

##### Pressed Surface
Use for active buttons, toggled controls, selected tabs, and inset wells.

```css
.sk-surface.is-pressed {
  transform: translateY(1px);
  background:
    linear-gradient(180deg, #d5dce8, #eef2f7 52%, #f8fafc) padding-box,
    linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(72, 84, 112, 0.38), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.62)) border-box;
  box-shadow:
    inset 0 4px 10px rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.22),
    inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.72),
    0 4px 10px rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.10);
}
```

##### Embossed Text And Icons
Use for labels inside tactile controls. Keep it subtle.

```css
.sk-label {
  color: #334155;
  text-shadow:
    0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.78),
    0 -1px 0 rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.12);
}

.sk-icon {
  filter:
    drop-shadow(0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.78))
    drop-shadow(0 -1px 0 rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.14));
}
```

##### Micro Texture
Use micro texture at low opacity. It should be felt, not noticed.

```css
.sk-texture {
  background-image:
    radial-gradient(circle at 20% 30%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.34) 0 1px, transparent 1.5px),
    radial-gradient(circle at 70% 65%, rgba(31, 41, 55, 0.08) 0 1px, transparent 1.5px);
  background-size: 18px 18px, 22px 22px;
}
```

##### Taste Rules
- Use one physical material per component: soft plastic, enamel, ceramic, metal, or rubber.
- Keep depth directional: light from top, shadow below.
- Avoid pure black shadows; use tinted grays or brand-tinted darks.
- Do not mix glassmorphism, neumorphism, and skeuomorphism in the same component.
- Reserve heavy pressed effects for interactive states, not every surface.
- Reduce texture on small controls so the UI stays crisp.

##### Quick Checks
- Raised state has a brighter top edge and darker lower edge.
- Pressed state reverses depth with inset shadows.
- Rounded corners stay smooth at the actual rendered size.
- The gradient border is 1px and does not overpower the content.
- Text and icons remain readable after shadow effects.

### industrial-brutalist-ui
**Description:** Raw mechanical interfaces fusing Swiss typographic print with military terminal aesthetics. Rigid grids, extreme type scale contrast, utilitarian color, analog degradation effects. For data-heavy dashboards, portfolios, or editorial sites that need to feel like declassified blueprints.


#### SKILL: Industrial Brutalism & Tactical Telemetry UI

##### 1. Skill Meta
**Name:** Industrial Brutalism & Tactical Telemetry Interface Engineering
**Description:** Advanced proficiency in architecting web interfaces that synthesize mid-century Swiss Typographic design, industrial manufacturing manuals, and retro-futuristic aerospace/military terminal interfaces. This discipline requires absolute mastery over rigid modular grids, extreme typographic scale contrast, purely utilitarian color palettes, and the programmatic simulation of analog degradation (halftones, CRT scanlines, bitmap dithering). The objective is to construct digital environments that project raw functionality, mechanical precision, and high data density, deliberately discarding conventional consumer UI patterns.

##### 2. Visual Archetypes
The design system operates by merging two distinct but highly compatible visual paradigms. **Pick ONE per project and commit to it. Do not alternate or mix both modes within the same interface.**

###### 2.1 Swiss Industrial Print
Derived from 1960s corporate identity systems and heavy machinery blueprints.
*   **Characteristics:** High-contrast light modes (newsprint/off-white substrates). Reliance on monolithic, heavy sans-serif typography. Unforgiving structural grids outlined by visible dividing lines. Aggressive, asymmetric use of negative space punctuated by oversized, viewport-bleeding numerals or letterforms. Heavy use of primary red as an alert/accent color.

###### 2.2 Tactical Telemetry & CRT Terminal
Derived from classified military databases, legacy mainframes, and aerospace Heads-Up Displays (HUDs).
*   **Characteristics:** Dark mode exclusivity. High-density tabular data presentation. Absolute dominance of monospaced typography. Integration of technical framing devices (ASCII brackets, crosshairs). Application of simulated hardware limitations (phosphor glow, scanlines, low bit-depth rendering).

##### 3. Typographic Architecture
Typography is the primary structural and decorative infrastructure. Imagery is secondary. The system demands extreme variance in scale, weight, and spacing.

###### 3.1 Macro-Typography (Structural Headers)
*   **Classification:** Neo-Grotesque / Heavy Sans-Serif.
*   **Optimal Web Fonts:** Neue Haas Grotesk (Black), Inter (Extra Bold/Black), Archivo Black, Roboto Flex (Heavy), Monument Extended.
*   **Implementation Parameters:**
    *   **Scale:** Deployed at massive scales using fluid typography (e.g., `clamp(4rem, 10vw, 15rem)`).
    *   **Tracking (Letter-spacing):** Extremely tight, often negative (`-0.03em` to `-0.06em`), forcing glyphs to form solid architectural blocks.
    *   **Leading (Line-height):** Highly compressed (`0.85` to `0.95`).
    *   **Casing:** Exclusively uppercase for structural impact.

###### 3.2 Micro-Typography (Data & Telemetry)
*   **Classification:** Monospace / Technical Sans.
*   **Optimal Web Fonts:** JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Space Mono, VT323, Courier Prime.
*   **Implementation Parameters:**
    *   **Scale:** Fixed and small (`10px` to `14px` / `0.7rem` to `0.875rem`).
    *   **Tracking:** Generous (`0.05em` to `0.1em`) to simulate mechanical typewriter spacing or terminal matrices.
    *   **Leading:** Standard to tight (`1.2` to `1.4`).
    *   **Casing:** Exclusively uppercase. Used for all metadata, navigation, unit IDs, and coordinates.

###### 3.3 Textural Contrast (Artistic Disruption)
*   **Classification:** High-Contrast Serif.
*   **Optimal Web Fonts:** Playfair Display, EB Garamond, Times New Roman.
*   **Implementation Parameters:** Used exceedingly sparingly. Must be subjected to heavy post-processing (halftone filters, 1-bit dithering) to degrade vector perfection and create textural juxtaposition against the clean sans-serifs.

##### 4. Color System
The color architecture is uncompromising. Gradients, soft drop shadows, and modern translucency are strictly prohibited. Colors simulate physical media or primitive emissive displays.

**CRITICAL: Choose ONE substrate palette per project and use it consistently. Never mix light and dark substrates within the same interface.**

###### If Swiss Industrial Print (Light):
*   **Background:** `#F4F4F0` or `#EAE8E3` (Matte, unbleached documentation paper).
*   **Foreground:** `#050505` to `#111111` (Carbon Ink).
*   **Accent:** `#E61919` or `#FF2A2A` (Aviation/Hazard Red). This is the ONLY accent color. Used for strike-throughs, thick structural dividing lines, or vital data highlights.

###### If Tactical Telemetry (Dark):
*   **Background:** `#0A0A0A` or `#121212` (Deactivated CRT. Avoid pure `#000000`).
*   **Foreground:** `#EAEAEA` (White phosphor). This is the primary text color.
*   **Accent:** `#E61919` or `#FF2A2A` (Aviation/Hazard Red). Same red, same rules.
*   **Terminal Green (`#4AF626`):** Optional. Use ONLY for a single specific UI element (e.g., one status indicator or one data readout) — never as a general text color. If it doesn't serve a clear purpose, omit it entirely.

##### 5. Layout and Spatial Engineering
The layout must appear mathematically engineered. It rejects conventional web padding in favor of visible compartmentalization.

*   **The Blueprint Grid:** Strict adherence to CSS Grid architectures. Elements do not float; they are anchored precisely to grid tracks and intersections.
*   **Visible Compartmentalization:** Extensive utilization of solid borders (`1px` or `2px solid`) to delineate distinct zones of information. Horizontal rules (`<hr>`) frequently span the entire container width to segregate operational units.
*   **Bimodal Density:** Layouts oscillate between extreme data density (tightly packed monospace metadata clustered together) and vast expanses of calculated negative space framing macro-typography.
*   **Geometry:** Absolute rejection of `border-radius`. All corners must be exactly 90 degrees to enforce mechanical rigidity.

##### 6. UI Components and Symbology
Standard web UI conventions are replaced with utilitarian, industrial graphic elements.

*   **Syntax Decoration:** Utilization of ASCII characters to frame data points.
    *   *Framing:* `[ DELIVERY SYSTEMS ]`, `< RE-IND >`
    *   *Directional:* `>>>`, `///`, `\\\\`
*   **Industrial Markers:** Prominent integration of registration (`®`), copyright (`©`), and trademark (`™`) symbols functioning as structural geometric elements rather than legal text.
*   **Technical Assets:** Integration of crosshairs (`+`) at grid intersections, repeating vertical lines (barcodes), thick horizontal warning stripes, and randomized string data (e.g., `REV 2.6`, `UNIT / D-01`) to simulate active mechanical processes.

##### 7. Textural and Post-Processing Effects
To prevent the design from appearing purely digital, simulated analog degradation is engineered into the frontend via CSS and SVG filters.

*   **Halftone and 1-Bit Dithering:** Transforming continuous-tone images or large serif typography into dot-matrix patterns. Achieved via pre-processing or CSS `mix-blend-mode: multiply` overlays combined with SVG radial dot patterns.
*   **CRT Scanlines:** For terminal interfaces, applying a `repeating-linear-gradient` to the background to simulate horizontal electron beam sweeps (e.g., `repeating-linear-gradient(0deg, transparent, transparent 2px, rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 2px, rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 4px)`).
*   **Mechanical Noise:** A global, low-opacity SVG static/noise filter applied to the DOM root to introduce a unified physical grain across both dark and light modes.

##### 8. Web Engineering Directives
1.  **Grid Determinism:** Utilize `display: grid; gap: 1px;` with contrasting parent/child background colors to generate mathematically perfect, razor-thin dividing lines without complex border declarations.
2.  **Semantic Rigidity:** Construct the DOM using precise semantic tags (`<data>`, `<samp>`, `<kbd>`, `<output>`, `<dl>`) to accurately reflect the technical nature of the telemetry.
3.  **Typography Clamping:** Implement CSS `clamp()` functions exclusively for macro-typography to ensure massive text scales aggressively while maintaining structural integrity across viewports.

### glass-dark-ui
**Description:** Build dark-mode glassmorphism interfaces with readable contrast, frosted surfaces, and gradient borders using a pseudo-element mask. Use when asked for glass cards, frosted dark hero sections, blur panels, or dark UI systems with gradient/glow borders.


#### Glass Dark UI Skill

##### Workflow
1. Confirm environment (`HTML/CSS`, Tailwind, or React) and target surface (`hero`, `dashboard`, `modal`, `card`).
2. Define dark UI tokens first (background, glass fill, border glow, primary text, muted text).
3. Build frosted panels with `backdrop-filter`, transparent dark fill, and subtle inner highlight.
4. Apply the masked gradient border (`.border-gradient::before`) to key surfaces.
5. Add restrained depth (shadow + glow) and clear hover/focus states.
6. Validate contrast and mobile behavior before finalizing.

##### Base Tokens
Use these as defaults and tune per brand.

```css
:root {
  --bg-0: #020617;
  --bg-1: #0b1220;
  --glass-fill: rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.45);
  --glass-fill-strong: rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.62);
  --text-main: #e2e8f0;
  --text-muted: #94a3b8;
  --accent: #60a5fa;
}
```

##### Glass Panel Pattern

```css
.glass-panel {
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.02));
  background-color: var(--glass-fill);
  border-radius: 24px;
  box-shadow: 0 20px 48px rgba(2, 6, 23, 0.45), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);
  backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(140%);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(140%);
}
```

##### Border Gradient Pattern

```css
.border-gradient {
  position: relative;
}

.border-gradient::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  border-radius: inherit;
  padding: 1px;
  -webkit-mask: linear-gradient(#fff 0 0) content-box, linear-gradient(#fff 0 0);
  -webkit-mask-composite: xor;
  mask-composite: exclude;
  background: linear-gradient(
    145deg,
    rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.28) 0%,
    rgba(96, 165, 250, 0.36) 45%,
    rgba(168, 85, 247, 0.3) 70%,
    rgba(148, 163, 184, 0.18) 100%
  );
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

##### Tailwind Usage Pattern

```html
<section class="relative rounded-3xl border-gradient bg-slate-950/45 backdrop-blur-xl p-8 shadow-[0_20px_48px_rgba(2,6,23,0.45),inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.12)]">
  <h2 class="text-slate-100 text-2xl font-semibold">Frosted Panel</h2>
  <p class="text-slate-400 mt-2">Dark glass card with masked gradient border.</p>
</section>
```

##### Dark Mode Checklist
- Keep body text at least `#cbd5e1` on dark glass surfaces.
- Avoid pure black overlays over blur; use deep navy/charcoal alpha instead.
- Limit glow radius/intensity to preserve readability.
- Ensure focus rings are visible (`outline` or bright border state).
- Add fallback for non-blur environments: stronger solid background (`--glass-fill-strong`).

##### Common Requests This Skill Should Handle
- "Create a dark glass hero section with glowing border cards."
- "Convert this bright UI to dark glassmorphism without losing contrast."
- "Add border gradient glow to a frosted navbar/card/modal."
- "Make my dark dashboard feel premium with glass panels and subtle depth."

### dark-glass-clean-layout
**Description:** "Create a dark glass layout system with frosted premium shells, clean multi-column workspace structure, floating data cards, and restrained atmospheric depth."


#### Dark Glass Clean Layout Skill

##### Use When
- Create a dark glass layout system with frosted premium shells, clean multi-column workspace structure, floating data cards, and restrained atmospheric depth.

##### Workflow

##### Scope
- Apply this as a full design-system direction across background atmosphere, navigation, outer framing, layout columns, glass panels, floating cards, and motion.
- Use it when the interface should feel like a premium dark workspace or intelligence console built from calm glass shells and clean structural layout.
- This is not generic pastel glassmorphism and not a radial sci-fi instrument panel. The focus is a clean layout system with dark frosted depth and quiet hierarchy.

##### Visual target
- Build the page on a near-black base with soft atmospheric light or blurred WebGL texture behind the interface.
- Use a centered max-width layout shell with thin vertical boundary rails, tiny corner markers, and subtle framing so the page feels housed inside a precise workspace.
- Create the main hierarchy through dark frosted shells: sidebars, top navigation pills, floating data nodes, and operational cards should all feel glassy but controlled.
- Keep the palette mostly monochrome with white, zinc, smoke gray, and charcoal. If accent color is needed, derive it from the design or use it only for small state indicators.
- Let the center stage remain visually calm and breathable, with surrounding cards and rails supporting it rather than cluttering it.

##### Implementation guidance
- Prefer a multi-column workspace layout, such as left navigation, central hero or visualization stage, and right operational sidebar on desktop, then stack cleanly on smaller screens.
- Use one-pixel gradient wrappers or faint highlight edges around dark glass shells, then place darker translucent fills inside with strong backdrop blur.
- Glass surfaces should feel smoky and premium: low-opacity dark fills, crisp top-edge highlights, soft shadow falloff, and restrained internal reflections.
- Add floating supporting cards near the central stage for logs, intelligence notes, action plans, or system events, but keep their quantity limited and their spacing generous.
- Use mono micro-labels, system IDs, tiny metadata, and compact operational headings to give the glass layout technical credibility.
- Buttons, pills, and interactive rows should use clean rounded geometry, subtle hover brightening, and low-drama border emphasis instead of loud color floods.
- Background atmosphere can include blurred particle fields, faint line motion, or abstract WebGL forms, but it should stay soft enough that the glass layout remains primary.
- Motion should feel floating and premium: masked text reveals, slow drift on data cards, tiny parallax, and gentle blur or highlight shifts are appropriate.

##### Recommended patterns
- Fixed pill-shaped top navigation wrapped in a thin gradient edge with dark glass fill and strong blur.
- Left and right side shells built from stacked frosted cards, navigation groups, protocol steps, or telemetry modules.
- Central hero stage with restrained headline, soft radial wash behind the copy, and a simple high-contrast CTA.
- Floating info cards positioned around the center on large screens, using dark glass wrappers and tiny metadata footers.
- Thin vertical outer rails and tiny square corner marks to keep the workspace feeling aligned and architectural.
- Terminal-like or I/O cards that combine frosted shell depth with clean inner rows and muted system labels.

##### Tuning knobs
- Glass intensity: tune blur and opacity so shells read clearly as glass without becoming muddy or washed out.
- Layout openness: preserve enough negative space between columns and floating cards so the system feels calm and premium.
- Accent restraint: keep accent color limited to status dots, active text, or tiny indicators rather than large fills.
- Atmospheric depth: add or reduce background blur, particle glow, or abstract WebGL texture depending on how cinematic the layout should feel.
- Frame visibility: make outer rails and corner markers visible enough to organize the page without turning it into a hard technical grid.

##### Avoid
- Bright translucent glass cards floating over colorful blobs.
- Flattening the interface into plain black boxes with no frosted depth or layout elegance.
- Overcrowding the center with too many floating cards until the clean workspace structure collapses.
- Heavy neon glows or saturated effects that overpower the monochrome dark-glass system.
- Treating glass as a card style only instead of a full layout language spanning nav, sidebars, and supporting modules.

### blue-laser-clean-glass-layout
**Description:** "Create a clean dark glass layout system with a thin blue laser atmosphere, frosted premium shells, and polished dashboard structure."


#### Blue Laser Clean Glass Layout Skill

##### Use When
- Create a clean dark glass layout system with a thin blue laser atmosphere, frosted premium shells, and polished dashboard structure.

##### Workflow

##### Scope
- Apply this as a full design-system direction across background atmosphere, navigation, hero, floating cards, dashboard shells, tables, and motion.
- Use it when the interface should feel premium, dark, blue-led, and operational, with a restrained laser beam integrated into a clean glassy layout.
- This is not only a laser effect and not generic dark glassmorphism. The beam, fog, glass shells, and dashboard framing should all support one unified system.

##### Visual target
- Build the page on a near-black base with subtle blue undertones and a fixed atmospheric laser background behind the interface.
- Use a thin blue or indigo laser beam with a white-hot core, soft halo, and light volumetric smoke or fog so it reads cinematic but precise.
- Layer the UI above the laser using dark frosted shells, border-gradient wrappers, translucent pills, and glass-like premium cards.
- Keep typography crisp and modern: white display copy, muted blue-gray support text, and clean compact labels for product credibility.
- Let the overall tone feel clean and expensive rather than noisy sci-fi, with the laser acting as a focused spatial motif instead of a spectacle.

##### Implementation guidance
- Use a fixed full-screen canvas or background layer for the laser and fog, then keep all foreground UI in a separate scrollable content layer above it.
- Keep the laser narrow and elegant. Separate beam thickness from glow width so the line stays thin while the halo and smoke can breathe softly.
- Build navigation as a floating or sticky glass-dark pill with backdrop blur, thin borders, and calm white text.
- Use a framed central shell or max-width application container with border-x rails, tiny corner markers, or subtle vertical boundaries to structure the page.
- Introduce glass cards with dark translucent fill, one-pixel gradient borders, soft shadow falloff, and limited blue accent moments for charts, status chips, or icons.
- Dashboard sections should feel polished and modular: sidebars, metric cards, event streams, data tables, and search controls should share the same glass-dark surface logic.
- Use blue selectively for active indicators, CTA emphasis, icon accents, and the laser atmosphere while leaving most surfaces neutral and dark.
- Motion should remain calm and premium: masked headline reveals, subtle card drift, soft beam pulse, and gentle hover brightening are appropriate.

##### Recommended patterns
- Fixed blue laser and fog field behind a central glass dashboard or hero shell.
- Floating pill nav with blurred dark fill, rounded full-width geometry, and restrained white borders.
- Border-gradient metric cards and event panels hovering beside or above the hero copy.
- Large dashboard container with frosted header bar, muted tabs, sidebar modules, and a clean data table.
- Blue CTA button paired with a quieter outline or glass secondary button.
- Tiny blue live dots, underglow accents, and soft atmospheric bloom near the beam or focal modules.

##### Tuning knobs
- Laser intensity: keep the beam thin and readable while adjusting halo, pulse, and smoke separately.
- Blue mood: shift between indigo, cobalt, and cooler electric blue depending on how premium versus energetic the system should feel.
- Glass depth: tune blur, opacity, and edge highlights so shells feel premium without becoming muddy.
- Layout density: choose how many floating cards and dashboard modules appear around the hero before the clean composition starts to feel crowded.
- Atmosphere amount: let fog and bloom support the beam, but avoid filling the full page with haze.

##### Avoid
- Thick neon laser bars that overpower the layout.
- Flat dark dashboards with blue accents but no meaningful glass depth or atmospheric beam logic.
- Pastel glassmorphism, bright blobs, or translucent white cards that break the dark premium feel.
- Overdecorating every component with glow, blur, or border effects.
- Letting the laser or fog reduce readability of foreground content.

### clean-minimal-beige-light-mode
**Description:** "Create a clean minimal beige light-mode design system with warm neutral shells, quiet process grids, restrained accent color, and elegant low-contrast structure."


#### Clean Minimal Beige Light Mode Skill

##### Use When
- Create a clean minimal beige light-mode design system with warm neutral shells, quiet process grids, restrained accent color, and elegant low-contrast structure.

##### Workflow

##### Scope
- Apply this as a full design-system direction across page background, hero, shell, grid modules, cards, buttons, and motion.
- Use it when the interface should feel light, calm, premium, and process-oriented, with warm beige neutrals instead of cold white enterprise UI.
- This is not generic bright SaaS and not an ornate paper system. It should stay clean, minimal, and quietly operational.

##### Visual target
- Build the page on layered beige, stone, cream, and off-white surfaces with very low-contrast borders and subtle tonal separation.
- Use a centered master container or framed application shell that holds the experience together in a precise but understated way.
- Pair a simple centered hero with a modular lower information grid or process layout made of evenly divided blocks.
- Keep accent color sparse and purposeful, used only for key badges, active indicators, progress, or primary action states.
- Let the design feel highly organized and premium without relying on strong shadows, loud gradients, or heavy decorative effects.

##### Implementation guidance
- Prefer warm neutral backgrounds with a gentle radial or painted wash behind the main UI rather than flat plain white.
- Use thin borders, soft dividers, and restrained panel contrast to create hierarchy between sections and cards.
- Organize lower content into a rigid modular grid with equal columns, calm labels, short descriptions, and simple functional mock components.
- Buttons and pills should feel light, refined, and understated, using soft fills, tiny radius or low-radius corners, and subtle border treatment.
- Typography should remain modern and readable: clean sans-serif, modest weight contrast, quiet tracking, and balanced spacing.
- Motion should be subtle and clean: masked text reveals, mild fade-ins, and gentle background drift are enough.

##### Recommended patterns
- Large warm neutral hero with centered heading, small badge, and minimal CTA stack.
- Framed app shell or product block using light beige backgrounds and thin internal dividers.
- Process columns or modular info panels with consistent heights and restrained descriptive content.
- Small dark or tinted inset cards used sparingly as contrast moments within a mostly light composition.
- Tiny status dots, low-key progress bars, and minimal approval or routing cards that communicate process without clutter.

##### Tuning knobs
- Beige warmth: shift from cooler stone to warmer parchment depending on brand mood.
- Contrast level: keep enough separation between shells and panels to feel crisp, but avoid harsh black-on-white jumps.
- Accent intensity: use the accent as a signal color only, not as a dominant palette driver.
- Grid density: make the modular lower section information-rich but still breathable.
- Surface softness: allow slight softness in shadows and gradients, but keep the overall result disciplined and minimal.

##### Avoid
- Stark white SaaS layouts with cold gray borders and no warmth.
- Overdecorated paper textures, vintage distressing, or ornate editorial flourishes.
- Heavy shadows, high-saturation accents, or thick cards that break the quiet minimal tone.
- Filling every module with too much content until the process grid feels noisy.
- Turning the design into a dashboard-heavy system instead of a calm structured product presentation.

### dark-blue-contrasting-clean
**Description:** "Create a dark-blue clean design system with strong contrast, cobalt gradient feature blocks, crisp framed structure, and restrained premium glow."


#### Dark Blue Contrasting Clean Skill

##### Use When
- Create a dark-blue clean design system with strong contrast, cobalt gradient feature blocks, crisp framed structure, and restrained premium glow.

##### Workflow

##### Scope
- Apply this as a full design-system direction across page background, framing rails, hero or CTA bands, cards, link groups, navigation, and motion.
- Use it when the interface should feel premium, dark, crisp, and blue-led, with strong contrast between deep navy surfaces and brighter cobalt focal regions.
- This is not an airy cloud-blue system and not loud neon sci-fi. It should stay clean, architectural, and high-contrast.

##### Visual target
- Build the page on a near-black navy base, using dark blue-black backgrounds with subtle tonal variation rather than flat pure black.
- Introduce one or more prominent cobalt or royal-blue feature blocks as contrast moments, such as hero banners, CTA bands, spotlight cards, or product sections.
- Use white typography and pale-blue support text over the dark system so the contrast feels sharp, readable, and premium.
- Add thin outer rails, border-x container lines, small corner squares, and quiet framing detail so the layout feels disciplined and engineered.
- Let blue glow stay soft and localized, appearing in background blooms, button emphasis, or tiny live indicators instead of flooding the whole page.

##### Implementation guidance
- Prefer a framed max-width shell or inner container with vertical boundary lines and subtle corner markers holding the composition together.
- Use border-gradient wrappers for premium blue feature blocks and dark cards, then place cleaner inner fills inside them so the edge treatment stays crisp.
- Organize the layout in clean stacked zones: a high-impact contrast block, then quieter index or navigation areas, followed by a restrained legal or footer zone.
- Buttons and CTA cards should feel firm and premium, using dark translucent fills, blue-tinted borders, pale-blue copy, and hover states that brighten slightly.
- Typography should remain light and elegant: thin to regular sans-serif weights, generous spacing, and small uppercase utility lines for section numbering or metadata.
- Use subtle abstract blue light fields, large blurred glows, circular traces, or soft overlay washes to add atmosphere without weakening the clean structure.
- Motion should stay calm and premium: masked word reveals, fade-up sections, quiet icon drift, and gentle hover translation are appropriate.

##### Recommended patterns
- Large cobalt gradient banner or CTA block nested inside a dark framed container, with white headline and pale-blue support copy.
- Dark navy page shell with border-x rails and tiny corner squares marking the main content bounds.
- Clean multi-column link or info index using white headings, muted gray-blue links, and tiny numeric utility labels.
- Premium contact or action cards built from blue-to-transparent gradient wrappers and dark inner panels.
- Small live dots, section counters, or glow markers using bright blue as selective signal detail.
- Footer or lower-page legal area separated with thin white-alpha rules and minimal technical iconography.

##### Tuning knobs
- Blue intensity: shift between richer royal blue and darker steel-blue depending on how bold the system should feel.
- Contrast strength: keep text, dividers, and key blocks crisp against the dark base, but avoid harsh overexposure.
- Glow amount: use blur and bloom sparingly so the page feels atmospheric without becoming soft or hazy.
- Frame density: add or reduce rails, corner squares, and divider lines depending on how structured the layout should feel.
- Banner dominance: let the blue feature block act as the hero centerpiece or a secondary conversion zone depending on page needs.

##### Avoid
- Treating it like a light sky-blue or cloudy product page.
- Full-screen electric blue washes that destroy contrast and refinement.
- Flat dark layouts with blue text but no meaningful framed structure or contrast block.
- Overdecorating every card with glow, gradients, or glass effects.
- Heavy enterprise dashboard clutter that fights the clean architectural tone.

### funky-purple-container-tech
**Description:** "Create a dark container-led technical design system with fuchsia-purple accents, layered rounded shells, crisp frame lines, and playful futuristic focal objects."


#### Funky Purple Container Tech Skill

##### Use When
- Create a dark container-led technical design system with fuchsia-purple accents, layered rounded shells, crisp frame lines, and playful futuristic focal objects.

##### Workflow

##### Scope
- Apply this as a full design-system direction across outer shell, containers, cards, search bars, navigation, accent objects, and supporting motion.
- Use it when the interface should feel technical and premium, but also slightly funky, expressive, and fashion-forward rather than purely enterprise.
- This is not generic cyberpunk and not plain dashboard dark mode. It should blend strong container structure with vivid purple energy and a few playful futuristic gestures.

##### Visual target
- Build the experience on a near-black base with one or more large framed containers defining the composition.
- Use purple, fuchsia, or magenta as the primary accent family, with optional blue undertones for depth, glow, or secondary lighting.
- Let containers drive the system: bordered shells, rounded search/input bars, floating cards, inset panels, and framed side rails should create the page hierarchy.
- Keep the structure technical with thin borders, corner squares, vertical frame lines, and measured spacing, but allow a few funky hero elements such as a glowing orb, rotating text ring, floating card, or exaggerated lighting bloom.
- The result should feel like a futuristic talent platform, product shell, or creative tech network rather than a strict corporate dashboard.

##### Implementation guidance
- Prefer a centered max-width master container with visible outer boundaries, border rails, and corner markers so the page feels housed inside a deliberate system shell.
- Use layered container treatments: rounded pills, framed cards, border-gradient wrappers, and translucent dark panels with subtle blur.
- Introduce a purple focal object or atmospheric anchor such as a glowing sphere, radial floor-light, floating badge, or animated line field that energizes the composition.
- Typography can stay clean and modern, but supporting UI should use uppercase utility text, micro-labels, and structured metadata for technical credibility.
- Search bars, action rows, and floating cards should look premium and tactile, with dark fill, soft inner shadow, gradient edge treatment, and accent hover response.
- Motion should feel smooth and stylish: masked text reveals, floating hero objects, slow pulse on glows, drifting line animations, or gentle ring rotation are good fits.

##### Recommended patterns
- Large dark container with border-x rails, tiny corner squares, and inner sections arranged within a clear technical grid.
- Rounded search or filter bars wrapped in subtle gradient borders, placed inside a dark glass-like shell.
- Floating info card using a purple-to-blue accent edge, high-radius corners, and strong depth separation from the background.
- Decorative focal objects such as glowing purple spheres, orbit rings, ambient bottom lighting, or animated line fields that sit behind the content.
- Footer or action bars that continue the container language with segmented inputs and restrained accent arrows or chips.

##### Tuning knobs
- Purple mood: shift between richer magenta, electric fuchsia, or cooler violet depending on how playful or premium the page should feel.
- Container roundness: keep the shells rounded and polished, but balance them with crisp frame logic so the design stays technical.
- Funk factor: add or reduce dramatic focal objects, glows, and animated decorative elements depending on how experimental the design should be.
- Lighting: keep bloom and underglow concentrated around hero objects or focal surfaces rather than washing the whole page.
- Structure density: add or reduce rails, corner marks, and side modules so the layout can lean more clean or more instrumented.

##### Avoid
- Flat dark pages with purple accents but no meaningful container hierarchy.
- Turning every surface neon so the composition loses focus.
- Generic SaaS card grids that ignore the central framed shell.
- Overdoing the weirdness until the interface stops feeling premium and usable.
- Mixing too many unrelated accent colors that weaken the purple-led identity.
